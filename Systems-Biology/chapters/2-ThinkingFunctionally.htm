    <td width="557"><p>To think and talk about systems biology we are going to have to get comfortable with a number of terms, many of them mathematical. The first is one that we already introduced at the end of the previous reading when we talked about the  probability (<strong>p</strong>) of a <em>H. saltator</em> worker switching from infertile to fertile as a &quot;function&quot; of population size (<strong>n</strong>) or <strong>p</strong> = <em><strong>f</strong></em>(<strong>n</strong>). </p>
      <p>What does this mean?</p>
      <p>It means that there is a reproducible and quantitative relationship between the probability of fertility conversion from worker to queen (we will assume that the probability  of a queen switching from fertile to infertile is zero, so we will ignore it) per unit time and population size. We should be able to make a drawing (a graph) of this relationship. </p>
      <p>It does not (necessarily) mean that we will be able to predict which worker will, during any particular time period, progress to fertility, rather we will be able to predict the likihood that one out the population of workers   will.      The behavior of the individuals is referred to as stochastic, which means it is determined by random event acting on a system - the fertility transition function for the population, however, is characterize by definite  probability. </p>
    <p>This is very much like radioactive decay of atoms, we know the probability of decay of the population of atoms, but we do not know (and it appears we cannot theoretically know) which atom will decay next. </p></td>

    <p>At the start, the system is perturbed - a force is applied to the white ball. Knowing the law of   conservation of momentum,  the elasticity of the balls and the system edges, and the friction between balls and table surface, we can predict the position of each ball at any time into the future.

    <td width="557"><p><strong>Back to the ants: </strong>So the question is, what does <strong>p</strong> = <em><strong>f</strong></em>(<strong>n</strong>)  look like? </p>
      <p>Because it is a probablity, <strong>p</strong> must be a number between 0 (never  happens) and 1 (always happens). </p>
      <p>Alternatively, we could    make  prediction based on some more or less simple assumptions. For example, if n = 1 then there are no  inhibitory interactions between workers, so <strong>p</strong> would be expected to equal its maximum possible value - let us say for the sake of argument that p = 1 when n = 1. That means that the one worker will transform into a fertile queen. </p>
      <p>We also know that in the absence of a queen, there is a real probability that some workers will be transformed into queens, so that as n increases p will decrease, and approach some number, greater than 0. </p>
      <p>In reality the system is complicated by the fact that once a worker transforms into a fertile queen, it will inhibit other workers from a similar transformation, p will decrease. In fact, this means that p is a function of both the number of workers AND the number of queens in the population. </p>
      <p>TO GO FURTHER, we will need to test how well our simple model of the system captures the the poulation's actual behavior, we will need some actual data. </p>
      <p>One approach would be for you to set up a number of colonies, perhaps distinct colonies with 2, 10, 30, or 60 individuals, and then count the number of  workers had become fertile per unit time, assuming that you had a non-destructive method for determining fertility. Since the process is stochastic, you might well want to look at multiple colonies of each size. <br>
        <br>
        We could then analyze the data we collected in terms of the average number of transformed workers as a percentage of population size and the calculate the standard deviation between different experiments. This, of course, assumes that different colonies are actually made up of identical workers (which may not be true).</p>
    <p>For example, in a colony n=1, and if one worker becomes fertile, then the p = 1. In a population of 10, if one worker becomes fertile (1/10) then p = 0.1, similarly if 2 workers became fertile in a populations of 30, then p = 2/30 or 0.067 [This could feed into data beSocratic activity]. </p></td>
