    <p>All biological systems  are    networks of objects (molecules, cells, tissues, and organisms) that interact in a variety of ways.  A number of factors make the biological networks particularly complex:  the   number interacting objects; they number of distinct types of interactions, and the fact that both objects and interactions are not static,  they can adapt and evolve. </p></td>

  <p> All known organisms known are composed of cells and all current evidence suggest  that these cells are related to one another, descended in a unbroken lineage  from a  &quot;last common ancestor&quot; that lived  ~3.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> years ago.  
  Current organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, differ from one another because of the details of their history, a history that defines the present and constrains the future.</p>
  <p>While it is common for biology courses to describe  the parts of organisms  and some of the most important interactions that occur between them, rarely is the system considered as a functioning, dynamic, adaptive and evolving whole. Such an perspective is necessary to really understand how biological systems  work and how they respond to  internal  and external factors. To attain that level of understanding, we  need to adopt a more analytical, and in the end, more mathematical approach. </p>
  <p>The goal of this course is consider a number of biological systems from a systems perspective. We will introduce analytical concepts and tools as we proceed through these systems, although inevitably it will require that we get comfortable with the  mathematical tools required.  </p>
  <p>We will consider a range of  behaviors, from the adaptation of bacteria  to changing environments   to patterning of embryos and the breakdown of social networks involved in various diseases. This means we will  consider how the underlying networks responsible for these behaviors are organized, how they normally (or typically) behave, and how they respond to  perturbations. </p></td>

      <p>A colony is  typically founded by a fertile individual, a queen. The eggs they lay develop into workers, who are reproductively inactive (<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00001724" target="_blank">Peeters et al., 2000</a>; <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4124.full" target="_blank">Liebig et al., 2000</a>).    </p>
    <p>This is an example of a a highly social species, in which different individuals in the colony are analogous to different cells in the body of multicellular organism, with the workers as the body (or soma) and the queen as the germ line.</p>
    <p>The evolution of social behavior (such as this) is based on the occurance of &quot; inclusive fitness. &quot;</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="557"><p>This means that, because they are related to the queen, if their (the workers) behavior leads to significantly greater reproductive success for the queen, that increase in reproductive success can more than compensate for their own lack of direct offspring, particularly when compared to the reproductive success of individuals living in isolation or without such a &quot;division of labor&quot;. </p>
      <p>At the same time, this type of structure makes the colony vulnerable. What would happen if the queen were to die? What we find is that the colony displays an underlying network organization that enables it to adapt to this eventuality. If the queen leaves the colony, some worker's become reproductively active.  </p>
      <p>This itself leads to the question, if workers can be become queens, what normally stops them from doing so? </p>
      <p>We can outline the majority components of this system in terms of objects (the individual ants) and their interactions with one another. </p>
      <p>At the onset there are two sets of individuals in the system, the reproductively inactive workers and the reproductively queen.  Let us assume that the favored state for an ant is to be  reproductively active, and we will represent each ant (the objects in our system) as either reproductively inactive (ant<sub>off</sub>), that is a worker or reproductive active (ant<sub>on</sub>), a queen. </p>
      <p>We can think of the ant<sub>off</sub> state as unstable, such that the transition between ant<sub>off</sub> → ant<sub>on</sub> occurs with some finite probability per unit time, while the reverse reaction ant<sub>on</sub> → ant<sub>off</sub> essentially does not occur. Queens do not turn back into workers, rather they leave or die. </p>
      <p>So one might expect that over time, all of the workers would become queens, and the advantage of the colony's &quot;division of labor&quot; would be lost. But, if we examine the normal situation we find that colonies are  stable – in the presence of the queen the workers remain workers. </p>
      <p>How do we understand the stability and adaptability of this system. If we  examine the interactions between these individuals, we see two types of behavior.      </p>
      <p>Workers   jump on top and hold down other workers. This activity appears to inhibit the the rate of reproductive transition. We can illustrate this interaction as: </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/on off reaction-1.jpg" width="108" height="48" alt="on off"></p>
      <p> which means that ant2 interacts with ant1 and inhibits ant1 from becoming reproductively active (the  ⊣ symbol means inhibition). Of course this interaction also occurs in the reciprocal manner, with ant1 jumping on ant2. This leads to an inhibitor loop:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/on off reaction-reciprocal.jpg" width="153" height="54" alt="reciprocal interaction"></p>
      <p align="left">But these interactions between workers do not appear to be sufficient to block reproductive progression, since  new queens appear  after the original queen leaves. </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, there is a second interaction in the system, between the queen and workers. This interaction also appears to inhibit the worker's reproductive progression. </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="../images/on off reaction-multiple.jpg" width="157" height="123" alt="interaction mutiple"></p>

    <td width="557"><p>We might even speculate that the reciprocal inhibitory interactions between workers removes some of this burden from the queen. </p>
      <p>In any case, we can see  evidence for the queen's inhibitory interactions when the queen is removed. The inhibitory interactions between workers are not sufficient to maintain their reproductively inactive state.    </p>
    <p>We know (and will illustrate repeatedly as we go on) that there are phenotypic variations between individuals that arise from a number of sources (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10760282" target="_blank">Liebig et al, 2000</a>), including stochastic (random) variations in gene expression  between genetically identical individuals. </p></td>
