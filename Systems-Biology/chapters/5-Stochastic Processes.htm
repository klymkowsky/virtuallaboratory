      <p>While much of our time will be spend examining molecular and cellular networks, it is perhaps worth considering with a range of biological systems to begin with to get comfortable with the nature of interactions and analysis methods that unlie complex biological behaviors. </p>
      <p>For examine, consider the ant <em>Harpognathos saltator</em>.  These animals live in small colonies  containing  ~50 individuals.

The eggs they lay develop into workers, who are reproductively inactive (<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00001724" target="_blank">Peeters et al., 2000</a>; <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4124.full" target="_blank">Liebig et al., 2000</a>). </p>
      <p>This is an example of a a highly social species, in which different individuals in the colony are analogous to different cells in the body of multicellular organism, with the workers as the body (or soma) and the queen as the germ line.</p>
      <p>This means that, because they are related to the queen, if their (the workers) behavior leads to significantly greater reproductive success for the queen, that increase in reproductive success can more than compensate for their own lack of direct offspring, particularly when compared to the reproductive success of individuals living in isolation or without such a &quot;division of labor&quot;. </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="557"><p>At the same time, this type of structure makes the colony vulnerable. What would happen if the queen were to die? What we find is that the colony displays an underlying network organization that enables it to adapt to this eventuality. If the queen leaves the colony, some worker's become reproductively active. </p>
      <p>This itself leads to the question, if workers can be become queens, what normally stops them from doing so? </p>
      <p>We can outline the majority components of this system in terms of objects (the individual ants) and their interactions with one another. </p>
      <p>At the onset there are two sets of individuals in the system, the reproductively inactive workers and the reproductively queen.  Let us assume that the favored state for an ant is to be  reproductively active, and we will represent each ant (the objects in our system) as either reproductively inactive (ant<sub>off</sub>), that is a worker or reproductive active (ant<sub>on</sub>), a queen. </p>
      <p>We can think of the ant<sub>off</sub> state as unstable, such that the transition between ant<sub>off</sub> → ant<sub>on</sub> occurs with some finite probability per unit time, while the reverse reaction ant<sub>on</sub> → ant<sub>off</sub> essentially does not occur. Queens do not turn back into workers, rather they leave or die. </p>
      <p>So one might expect that over time, all of the workers would become queens, and the advantage of the colony's &quot;division of labor&quot; would be lost. But, if we examine the normal situation we find that colonies are  stable – in the presence of the queen the workers remain workers. </p>
      <p>How do we understand the stability and adaptability of this system. If we  examine the interactions between these individuals, we see two types of behavior. </p>
      <p>Workers   jump on top and hold down other workers. This activity appears to inhibit the the rate of reproductive transition. We can illustrate this interaction as: </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/on off reaction-1.jpg" width="108" height="48" alt="on off"></p>
      <p> which means that ant2 interacts with ant1 and inhibits ant1 from becoming reproductively active (the  ⊣ symbol means inhibition). Of course this interaction also occurs in the reciprocal manner, with ant1 jumping on ant2. This leads to an inhibitor loop:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/on off reaction-reciprocal.jpg" width="153" height="54" alt="reciprocal interaction"></p>
      <p align="left">But these interactions between workers do not appear to be sufficient to block reproductive progression, since  new queens appear  after the original queen leaves. </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, there is a second interaction in the system, between the queen and workers. This interaction also appears to inhibit the worker's reproductive progression. </p>

      <p>In any case, we can see  evidence for the queen's inhibitory interactions when the queen is removed. The inhibitory interactions between workers are not sufficient to maintain their reproductively inactive state. </p>
      <p>We know (and will illustrate repeatedly as we go on) that there are phenotypic variations between individuals that arise from a number of sources (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10760282" target="_blank">Liebig et al, 2000</a>), including stochastic (random) variations in gene expression  between genetically identical individuals. </p></td>
