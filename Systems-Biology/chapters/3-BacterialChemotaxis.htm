    <td width="557"><p>Clearly the reproductive behavior of<em> H. saltator</em> is complex. As organisms, ants are  extremely complex &quot;objects&quot; and their interactions are complex as well.  In designing our ant experiments, it is not completely clear how we would get colonies that contained different numbers of workers. Would  it matter if they came from the same or different queens? Does it matter how long they spend in the presence (or absence) of a queen? Can I even &quot;grow up&quot; a colony of 60 individuals before one transforms into a queen? </p>
      <p>Because of these complexities, we will often turn to &quot;simpler&quot; systems to understand basic behaviors, or at least to how to approach thinking about and analyzing such behaviors - but even the simplest of the biological processes is quite complicated. </p>
      <p>In our case, our &quot;model&quot; system will be the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) and, initially, its ability to swim toward nutrients and away from &quot;repellants&quot;, typically noxious chemicals.  </p>
      <p>The basic mechanisms of this &quot;chemotaxis&quot; (chemical movement) involves the bacterium's flagella. A single <em>E. coli</em> cell has a number of flagella; these have the shape of long flexible fibers that are attached to a rotory motor. The motor is driven by hydrogen ion gradient established across the cell's plasma membrane. </p>
      <p>The motor can turn in either a counterclockwise (CCW)- or a clockwise (CW) direction. When it turns CCW, the flagella bundles together to form an effective propellar;  the turning of this propeller moves the bacterium &quot;forward&quot;. </p>
      <p>At various intervals, the flagellar motors reverse, and begin turning in a CW direction. When this happens, the flagellar bundle flies apart and bacterium tumbles (a process originally termed &quot;twiddling&quot;).  </p>
    <p>After awhile the flagellar motors reverse again, back to  CCW  rotation, and the bacteria swims off in a new, more or less random direction. <br>

      <p>Berg &amp; Tedesco reported that the global addition of an attractant (1 mM α-methyl-DL-aspartic acid), suppressed twiddling and promoted swimming. That is the switch from  CCW to the CW rotation was inhibited. </p>
    <p>In their experiment, there was no gradient, just a &quot;jump&quot; in the concentration.

      <p>This turns out not to be a simple as one might think ( it would be an interesting exercise if you made a list of  possible, physically plausible mechanisms). </p>
      <p>We can sum up the qualities of the bacterial chemotactic system, in must be</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptive</strong>:  able to respond to attractants and repellants over a larger range of concentrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive</strong>: able to detect small changes in molecular concentrations and turn them into modulate flagellar behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Robust</strong>: able to maintain the appropriate chemotactic behavior under a range of conditions, in particularly the fact that because transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation are stochastic processes, and cells are small, there can be significant levels of variation (noise) in the levels of various proteins.      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What  makes this a tricky problem is the size of the bacterial cell - normally no longer that 2 to 3 μm long, and the fact that it can detect small concentration gradients over a concentration range of five orders of magnitude.      </p>
      <p>So does the cell recognize the differences in concentrations between one end of the cell to other? How can this be done? </p>
    <p>Let us first get a feeling for the molecular nature of the problem. Assume that cell is located within a gradient of an attractant that changes from 0.0001 mM to 0.010 mM (a 10<sup>2</sup> fold change) over a 1 cm distance. How would you calculate the difference in the number of attractant molecules at the two ends of the cell?  [beSocratic activity]</p></td>

[<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14970819" target="_blank">McAdams et al., 2004</a>].</p>
      <p>There are a set of integral membrane receptor proteins, each &quot;tuned&quot; to bind to and respond to particular molecules.

  <tr>
    <td width="557"><p>These receptor proteins typically polypeptide dimers that are clustered at the  ends of the cell. In the case of an attractant, when occupied, these receptor proteins are methylated at up to four specific glutamate residues by  CheR methyltransferase proteins (&quot;Che&quot; stands for chemotaxis).  </p>
      <p>The membrane receptors form a complex with two other cytoplasmic proteins, a CheW dimer which acts primarily as an adaptor for the binding of CheA, a histidine kinase that (auto)phosphorylates CheA.  </p>
      <p>The higher the degree of receptor methylation, the more active is the CheA enzyme, so the more phosphorylated CheA protein (Che-P) there is. </p>
      <p> CheA-P can interact with, and transfer its phosphate group to either of  two  cytoplasmic proteins, CheY or CheB. CheY-P diffuses throughout the cytoplasm, and interacts with the cytoplasmic face of the flagellar motor, inducing CW  rotation, leading to tumbling.  When CheY-P is not bound, the motor rotates in the CCW direction - leading to forward swimming.</p>
      <p>The level of Che-Y-P in the cell is a function of the rate of generation by  CheA-P and its dephoshorylation by the protein phosphotase protein, CheZ. </p>
      <p>The second target of CheA-mediated phosphorylation is the demethylase CheB. Phosphorylated CheB (CheB-P) preferentially demethylates highly methylated receptor proteins, while CheR preferentially demethylates un-or hypomethylated receptor proteins.  </p>
    <p>Finally, the binding of an attractant molecule to an attractant receptor protein reduces the activity of the receptor-CheW-CheA kinase complex, while repellant molecule binding to a repleant receptor increases CheA activity.</p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Threshold effects and responsiveness:</strong> <br>
        <br>
An obvious question that we have not addressed is, how many CheY-P molecules have to interact with the flagellar motor to cause a CCW to CW rotation switch? </p>
    <p>This can be a tricky question to anwer within an intact organism, so various types of molecular biological tricks need to be used. </p>
    <p>In the studies by Schart et al (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/95/1/201.full.pdf#page=1&view=FitH" target="_blank">1988</a>) they re-engineered the CheY protein.  Normally, the transfer of a phosphate from CheA-P to Asp-13 of CheY leads to the &quot;active&quot; form of CheY, which drives CW rotation.</p>
    <p>They designed mutated form is CheY, by replacing Asp13 with an arginine (Y) residue and Tyr-106 with a tryptophan (W) residue to produce CheY<sup>YW</sup> which drives CW rotation in the absence of CheA phosphorylation. They replaced the endogenous (wild type) CheY gene with the gene encoding CheY<sup>YW</sup>. The expression of CheY<sup>YW</sup> is under the ontrol of a lactose responsible promoter, so it can be induced by IPTG - this enabled them to control the concentration of CheY<sup>YW</sup> in the cell. These cells also carried mutations that deleted CheA and CheZ, so their flagellar response should be totally dependent upon [CheY<sup>YW</sup>]. </p></td>

One involves the binding of certain number of CheYP molecules acts to throw a switch - this model predicts a &quot;step-type&quot; function in which [CheY-P] relates to flagellar rotation. The second model is one in which the binding of CheY-P to the motor system alters the probability of a CWW or CW rotation; this would predict a a &quot;non-step&quot; type behavior of both rotation bias and reversal frequency. </p>
    <p>We know that in the absense of CheY-P, the flagellar motor rotates in the CWW direction, so we can use the percentage of time the motor rotates CW (the CW bias) as a measure how CheY-P influences the motor direction. </p>

    <td><p><strong>Getting more quantitative: </strong></p>
    <p>We can also begin to express the interactions between between chemotactic components mathematically. </p>
    <p>For example, the level of of CheA activity depends upon the extent of methylation of a receptor protein dimer (Rm).  Rm is a function of CheR activity (which methylates undermethylated receptor proteins), phosphorylated CheB (which demethylates methylated receptor proteins), and the level of receptor ligand, which in the case of an attractant, inhibits the level of CheA autophosphorylation. </p>
    <p>The ligand binds to the receptor with a certain affinity, and the receptor may have different affinities for different ligands.  </p>
    <p>The system as a whole controls the level of phosphorylated CheY, which in turn controls the rotation direction of the flagellar motor. A maximual level, CheY-P leads to CW rotation and tumbling, at minimal level, CWW rotation, swimming and no tumbling.<span class="red"> [<strong>Question</strong>: does more mathematical part go here]</span></p>
    <p><strong>Adaptation: </strong></p>
    <p>Perhaps the most complex feature of the chemotactic system is its ability to adapt to attractant and repullsant concentrations for a very wide range of concentration, over 100,000 fold (10<sup>5</sup>).  So what does this mean and how does it work? </p>
    <p>The basic observation is that a particular concenration of ligand can, in a concentration jump experiment, produce a full response, that is, the completely suppression of tumbling, and that this full response can be seen over a wide range of concentrations. </p>
    <p>The ligand-receptor binding interaction involves two reactions: the first is the interaction between the ligand (L) and the receptor (R). This can be represented by the equation L + R → LR, with LR being the form that mediates the chemotactic response of the cell. </p>
    <p>The degree to which the LR complex exists is dependent upon the concentration of L or [L], the concentration of R [R], and the probability that a collision between L and R leads to the formation of the LR complex and the stability of that complex, which is related to both the strength of the LR interaction and the probablity that thermal collisions with other molecules, particularly water molecules, will knock them apart again. </p>

    <td><p>One assumption that we have made is that R is a single entity, but that might not be true.</p>
      <p>The R protein sits in the plasma membrane, where it will interact with other membrane molecules. In fact, the chemotactic receptors appear to be dimers. This opens the possibility that i) they could their binding of ligand molecular could be cooperative and ii) that it could be affected by interactions with neighboring (membrane) molecules. </p>
      <p>But what about the single entity assumption? How can we change the behavior of  protein? Well, one obvious way would be post-translational modification. In fact, as noted in our description of the system (above), Receptor molecules are subject to histidine-methylation and demethylation. </p>
      <p>It appears that each R polypeptide has up to four distinct histidine methylation sites, that can be modified through a reaction catalyzed by  CheR . This generates five different &quot;types&quot; of receptor, with from 0 to 4  sites methylated. While experimental data indicates that (at least in the case of those receptors studied), methylation does not alter ligand binding affinity, it does alter the activity of  CheA, as monitored by the concentration of phosphorylated CheY in the cell.  </p>
    <p>This means that  very different concentrations of attractant (or repellant) can produce similar levels of CheY-P, apparently be producing  different levels of CheA activity    </p></td>
