          translation, to form macromolecules (RNAs and proteins). These macromolecules

                 regulate cellular behavior, tissue and organ formation and organismic

<p>DNA also encodes a second type of information
                that is involved in determining where,

            expression is regulated by gene products (interacting with DNA sequences)

          due to variations in gene packaging is the subject of epigenetics.</p>

            it might seem unlikely, mutations can be useful

                    each generation, the population of organisms accumulates more
                    and more different mutations -
                    more and more genetic variation.&nbsp; </font>A similar process
                     occurs during the development and maintenance of an organism
                    (different
                    cells in the body can have different genotypes) and such
            differences can lead to disease, most dramatically, to cancer.&nbsp; </p>

                the phenotypic differences associated with a particular genotype
          are subtle, other times dramatic.&nbsp;Most phenotypes are due to the action of many genes, acting together, but some arise from variations in a single gene.&nbsp;Different versions of a gene are known as <strong>alleles</strong> of that gene.&nbsp; </font></p>
