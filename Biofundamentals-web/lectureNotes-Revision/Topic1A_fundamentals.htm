<p>Different types of organisms, known as species, are defined as different by their "reproductive isolation" from one another. <br>
<br>
It is estimated that there are &gt; 1,500,000 (1.5 x 10<span class="c1"><sup>6</sup></span>) types of living organisms, of which ~750,000 are insects, ~250,000 are plants, and ~41,000 are vertebrates ("&gt;" means greater than, "~" means "approximately"). </p>
<p>The number of distinct microbial species remains difficult to determined accurately, in part because of the ubiquity of what is known as "horizontal gene transfer" and the lack of sexual reproduction in such organisms (we will return to these topics later in the course). </p>
<p>While there are currently millions of different types of organisms, over the course of Earth's history there have been even more. Most types of organisms that have existed no longer do, they are <strong>extinct.</strong> To be extinct means that they have no living descendants.</p>
<p>Today there are organisms that range in size from less than 0.000001 (10<span class="c1"><sup>-6</sup></span>) meters (1 µm) to more than 30 meters long, a range of over 10<span class="c1"><sup>7</sup></span> fold.</p>

<p>Organisms <span class="c1">range from those consisting of a single-cell, known generically as microbes, to multicellular plants and animals that can contain over 10<sup>13</sup> distinct cells. </span></p>
<p class="c3">A particular type of organism can live independently or in communities, and different types of organisms live together in <strong>ecosystems</strong>. For example, microbes often live together in biofilms. Within a biofilm, organisms can cooperate or compete (or both) with one another in complex and evolving ways. In fact, some organisms are so co-dependent that we have yet to discover how to grow them in isolation from one another. </p>
<p class="c3">Right now, there are many microbes living within your gut, and together with you, they form an "enteric" ecosystem [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21787875" target="_blank">link</a>]. </p>
<p><span class="c1">The simplest form of multicellular organisms are colonies of related cells, held together in loose aggregates. </span>In these simple colonial organisms, all cells can reproduce.  </p>
<p>A major innovation in the history of life was the appearance of true multicellular organisms. Multicellular organisms are social organisms, different types of cells carry out different functions and only a small subset of cells, known as <strong>germ cells</strong>, give rise to the next generation of organisms. Other cells, known as <strong>somatic cells</strong>, form the body of the organism, and perform specific roles, but all somatic cells die when the organism dies. Social evolution involves what is known as "inclusive fitness".</p>
<p>In a multicellular organism, control of cellular behavior is critical and complex.  For example, when somatic cells begin to divide in an uncontrolled (anti-social) manner, the result is cancer. To guard against anti-social behavior, multicellular organisms (and social groups) use various strategies.  </p>
<p>Inclusive fitness has allowed evolution to produce social organisms, like humans, in which a range of interactions are critical for reproductive success.  Evolutionary mechanisms can produce <strong>eusocial</strong> organisms, where individuals act as a part of super-organism; bee hives and naked mole rat colonies behave in this way.  In eusocial organisms, only a limited subset of organisms reproduce to form the next generation, like the germ line of a multicellular organism [<a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ccab/Alexander1974.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>][<a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-eusociality-15788128" target="_blank">link</a>]. </p>

<p class="c3">In an ecosystem, organisms have to deal with the impacts of other organisms on their physical environment. </p>
<p class="c3">The most dramatic life-based environmental impact to date has been the generation of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as a waste product of one form of photosynthesis. <span class="c1">O<sub>2</sub> is highly reactive.
