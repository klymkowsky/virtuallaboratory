        organisms often do not  mate randomly, and generally the larger parental

            many types of organisms, and most vertebrates, females (the sex that
            produces the larger gametes) either choose their mating partners
                or males (the sex that produces the smaller gametes) contend with
                one another to control access to females.&nbsp;</font>Under
            some conditions, females also compete with other females for access

          human pregnancy as an example.&nbsp; A

    <td width="307" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="style14"> <p>One of the most robust and reliable findings
        in the scientific literature on interpersonal attraction is the overwhelming
        role played by physical attractiveness in defining the ideal romantic
            partner (Hatfield &amp; Sprecher,
        1986; Jackson, 1992). </p>
        <p>Both men and women express marked preference for
            an attractive partner in a noncommitted short-term (casual, one night
            stand) relationship (Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993). </p>
        <p>For committed long-term relationships,
            females appear to be willing to relax their demand for a partner's
            attractiveness, especially for males with high social status or good
            financial prospects (for a review see Buss, 1999). </p>
        <p>Males also look
            for various personality qualities (kindness, understanding, good
            parental skills) in their search for long-term mating partners, but
            unlike females, they assign disproportionately greater importance
            to attractiveness compared to other personal qualities (Buss, 1999).            </p>
        <p>The paramount importance of attractiveness in males' mate choices
            has been recently demonstrated by using the distinction between necessities
            (i.e., essential needs, such as food and shelter) and luxuries (i.e.,
            objects that are sought after essential needs have been satisfied,
            such as a yacht or expensive car) made by economists. </p>
        <p>Using this method,
            Li et al., (2002) reported that males treat
            female attractiveness as a necessity in romantic relationships; given
            a limited &quot;mating
            budget,&quot; males allocate the largest proportion of their budget
            to physical attractiveness rather than to other attributes such as
            an exciting personality, liveliness, and sense of humor. </p>

    <td width="511" class="style17"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sexual selection can
                    lead to seemingly maladaptive traits. Consider the peacock's
                    tail.&nbsp; It takes a continuous supply of energy to generate
        a large, symmetrical and colorful tail.&nbsp; It can also make the male
        more vulnerable to predators. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other
        hand, the presence of a gaudy tail implies that its owner is
        able to successfully compete with others for resources, and so
        is likely to be genetically &quot;well 
      endowed&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once females notice tail size
        as a marker of success, they select as mates those males with the largest
    and most attractive tails. </font></p>
    <p>This can lead to <font color="#990000">runaway'
            selection</font>, the more prominent the male's tail
            the more likely he will find a mate, even though it may
    also have negative effects.&nbsp; For example, the development of extremely large
            antlers, associated with male dominance and mate accessibility, as
            occurred in <em>Megaloceros
            giganteous, </em>can
    inhibit their ability to move through heavily wooded areas.</p>
    <p class="style17">As their environment changed,
      their behavior and phenotypes could act to limit their ability to
      adapt fast enough to avoid extinction.</p>
    <p>In the end, as with all adaptations, there is
      a balance between the positive effects, which lead to increased
      reproductive success (such as access to mates) and their negative
      effects, which can influence survival.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The optimal form of a trait may not be stable
    over time, particularly if the environment is changing. </p></td>
