<p class="c5"><strong>Regulating protein activity:</strong></p>
<p class="c5">Proteins act through their interactions with other molecules.  Enzymes interact with substrate molecules; these interactions lower the activation energy of the reaction's rate limiting step, leading to an increase in the overall reaction rate. </p>
<p class="c5">At the same time, cells and organisms are not static.  They must regulate protein activity to adapt to changes in their environment or within the organism. </p>
<p class="c5">A protein's activity can be regulated in a number of ways. The first and most obvious is to control the total number of protein molecules present within the system.  </p>
<p class="c5">Let us assume that once synthesized, a protein is fully active. With this simplifying assumption, the total concentration protein in a system [P<sub>sys</sub>] is proportional to</p>
<p class="c6">(the rate of protein synthesis) minus (the rate of protein degradation). </p>
<p><span class="c3"><strong>What controls the rate of protein synthesis?</strong>  Clearly this is primarily a function of the number of mRNAs encoding the protein present in the cell. </span><span class="c3">It is generally the case that once translation begins, it continues at a more or less constant rate. </span></p>

<p class="c5">An allosteric effector can also act negatively, inhibiting an enzyme's activity.</p>

<p><span class="c3">In some cases, the inhibitor chemically reacts with the enzyme, forming a covalent bond. </span><span class="c3">Because this type of inhibitor is essentially irreversible, increasing substrate concentration does not overcome inhibition.

<p><span class="c3">Allosteric effectors are also non-competitive, since they do not compete with substrate for binding to the active site.</span> That said, binding of substrate could, in theory, change the affinity of the protein for allosteric effectors, just as binding of the allosteric effector changes the binding affinity of the protein for the substrate.</p>

<p class="c5">The first type involve the covalent addition of specific groups to specific sites on the protein - these groups can range from phosphate groups (phosphorylation), an acetate group (acetylation), the attachment of lipid/hydrophobic groups (lipid modification), or carbohydrates (glycosylation). </p>

<p><span class="c3">Post-translational modifications act in much the same way as do allosteric effectors, they modify the structure and, in turn, the activity of the polypeptide to which they are attached. </span><span class="c3">They can also modify a proteins interactions with other proteins, the protein's localization within  the cell, or its stability. </span></p>
