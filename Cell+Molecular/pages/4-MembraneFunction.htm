For example, these proteins will determine whether a cell forms part of an integrated sheet of cells (an epithelium), forms specific interactions (e.g. in the case of nerve and muscle, glial cell and neuron, neuron with neuron, immune system cells with one another, etc.).<br />            <br />          </li>        </ul></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="201"><div align="right"><img src="../../BioFun-Support/AllGraphics/cellorganization.jpg" width="200" height="240" alt="membranes" /></div></td>  </tr></table><table width="720" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><ul>          <li>Cell-cell interactions can involve a range of junctional complexes mediated by specific membrane and membrane-associated proteins. These can determine both tissue architecture as well as cell-cell signal transmission and metabolic coupling through gap junctions, various types of signaling junctions (synapses) in animal cells, or plasmodesmata in plants. </li>          <li>Membrane specializations can control molecular movements into and out of the cell and within it. </li>          <li>Just as membranes have a polarity, cellular sheets have a polarity, this can lead to polarized transport processes that depend upon regional specializations in membrane structure and composition. </li>          <li>Polarized membrane transport underlies a range of processes including ATP synthesis (through H+ gradients), digestive compartments (again based on H+ gradients), neuronal signal conduction, muscle contraction, and targeted cell killing. </li>          <li>The integrity of the membrane, in terms of controlled transport, is critical to these functions. <br />          Many toxins act by disrupting membrane integrity; they can be quite specific (effecting a single type of molecule) or can act by disrupting the membrane integrity generally. </li>          <li>Molecular gradients associated with membranes are established and maintained by protein &ldquo;pumps&rdquo; which act by i) using light energy to directly drive the vectorial transport H+ across a membrane (purple membrane), ii) light or chemical energy to transport H+ across a membrane (photosynthesis and respiration), or iii) by coupling the transport process to ATP hydrolysis reactions. </li>          <li>The reverse reaction, where movement of H+ down its concentration gradient through a membrane-bound ATP synthase is used to generate ATP from ADP and Pi. </li>          <li>&ldquo;Secondary translocators&rdquo; such as coupled &ldquo;sym-&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-&rdquo; porter proteins can exploit preexisting gradients to move molecules against their concentration gradients. </li>          <li>The specificity of a channel, carrier, or pump is based on the structure of the protein and the molecule or molecular complex to be transported. </li>          <li>Toxins that act as carriers or pores act to collapse concentration gradients; in the absence of such a pre-existing gradient, they would have no effect. </li>          <li>Poisons that inhibit the catalytic activity of pumps will lead to the dissipation of existing gradients over time. </li>          <li>Coupled reactions between pumps and selective channels can be use to establish electric fields across membranes.</li>          <li>Such fields can be used as batteries or signaling transmission systems.</li>          <li>The activity of proteins can be regulated by either post-translational modification, allosteric effectors (e.g. neurotransmitters), or electric fields (voltage-gated channels). </li>          <li>Fast acting changes mediated by membrane bound proteins often involve altered membrane permeability; slower acting processes typically involve &ldquo;second messenger&rdquo; regulated cascades of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. <br />          </li>        </ul>          <p><strong>Questions to ponder </strong> </p>          <ul><li>Why do molecules like symporters and antiporters exist?
