You have a test tube containing 10 ml of LB broth, which contains living  E. coli   at a  concentration of  exactly  500,000 individuals per ml. This is a number that typically occurs twice in a batch  culture experiment like ours. Your task is to create a dilution, make two plates, count the number of  colonies, use these numbers to estimate the original concentration, and then see how closely this estimate  matches reality. We first dilute into and then plate milliliters of sample (at least .001 ml) milliliters of sterile LB  (at most 10 ml) milliliters  onto each of two  dishes (at most .5 ml). Diluition practice.

You counted   and for an average of colonies on plate 1 colonies per plate. Your estimate for total CFUs in  the original  sample is:   times = (conversion factor) (average of counts) CFUs. Your estimate for CFU  concentration in the original   sample is   divided by 10 milliliters ( amount in original sample) = (CFU estimate) CFUs per milliliter. colonies on plate 2 Recall that you put   into and then plated milliliters of sample milliliters of sterile LB milliliters  onto two dishes.
