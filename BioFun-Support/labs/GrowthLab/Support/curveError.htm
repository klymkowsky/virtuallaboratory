It may have been as much as a minute off. </p>          <p>There are variations in the accuracy of the spectrophotometer. If             you look at the vSpec dial, you can see that it is possible to estimate             A only so accurately. This limit of accuracy is reflected in the concept             of significant digits, associated with every measurement. <b><a href="sigDigit.htm">Your             vTA can explain this is greater detai</a></b>l. </p>          <p><b><u>Some are more subtle in nature &amp; arise from the complexities             of bacterial growth. </u></b></p>          <p>We speak of a doubling time as if it were a single number, associated             with the maximum (exponential) growth rate. </p>          <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="3">            <tr>              <td width="35%" bgcolor="#CCCCFF">                 <p align="center"><b>p(t) = p0*e^mu*t</b></p>                <hr>                <p align="center"> <b>dp/dt =mu*p(t)</b></p>              </td>              <td width="65%">                 <p><b>p(t)</b>: population at a particularly time</p>                <p><b>t</b>: time</p>                <p><b>p0</b>: population at time = 0</p>                <p><b>mu</b>: bacterial growth rate</p>                </td>            </tr>          </table>          <p><b>You can interpret the differential equation in this way: </b>Each             unit of bacterial biomass produces the same amount of new bacterial             biomass over a certain small interval of time. </p>          <p align="left">While this is a good &quot;first order&quot; approximation             of the behavior of a bacterial population, it is not completely accurate.             Bacterial populations growing under conditions of limited resources             (e.g. in 5 ml of LB broth) display (at least) three distinct phases             of growth. </p>          <p align="left">In<b> lag phase</b> the bacteria are adaptating from             the conditions found within a colony growing on an agar surface to             the conditions of scattered cells in an aqueous environment. </p>          <p align="left">In<b> stationary phase</b>, the bacteria have exhausted             some of the nutrients in the broth and growth slows dramatically.           </p>          <p align="left">Between these two phases is the period known as the             <b>log phase</b>; in<b> log phase</b> the bacteria are expressing             the proper genes for rapid growth and abundant nutrients are readily             available to all. </p>          <b>Each phase is characterized by a different growth rate. </b>           <hr>          <p>If, when you calculate the log phase growth rate, you include measurements             from lag or stationary phases, (when growth is much slower if it occurs             at all), your estimate of growth rate will be too low. </p>          <p>During log phase, bacteria take nutrients from the medium and turn             them into bacterial biomass as fast as they can. This lowers nutrient             concentrations. </p>          <p>We can define the efficiency of this process. The grams of nutrient             needed to produce a gram of bacterial biomass is the biomass yield<b>             Y</b>. Under most conditions <b>Y</b> is reasonably constant. A notable             exception occurs as the cells approach their maximum growth temperature;             the bacteria must continually rebuild and replace heat-denatured macromolecules             and their biomass yield (<b>Y</b>) plummets.</p>          <hr>          As bacterial biomass concentration increases by <b>m</b> grams per time           interval, it follows that the nutrient concentration decreases by 1/Y*m.           <p><b>The rate of nutrient uptake is limited:</b> Normally, the amount             of nutrient that a bacterium can sequester and convert into bacterial             biomass depends on the concentration of the nutrient in the solution.</p>          <p>The maximum rate of nutrient uptake is determined by cellular surface             area. The cell membrane can accommodate only a certain number of the             protein &quot;transporters&quot;, used to bring nutrients into the             cell. This places an upper limit on the rate at which a bacteria can             capture nutrients.</p>          <p>At very low nutrient concentrations, the bacteria give up trying             to gather nutrients. In the &quot;real world&quot; bacteria live most             of their lives under conditions of limiting nutrients.</p>          <p>As the bacterial population grows it reaches the point where current             growth significantly reduces nutrient concentrations, making future             growth slower. </p>          </td>        <td bordercolor="#999999" width="46%">          <p>Growth occurs at the maximal rate only early in log phase; because the concentration             of bacteria is relatively low, the amount of nutrient used to make             new bacteria is small and does not significantly alter nutrient concentration.           </p>          <p>As the number and mass of bacteria increases, nutrient concentration             begins to drop rapidly and the rate at which the bacteria can produce             new biomass also drops. This means that the growth rate <b>&micro;</b>,             decreases with time. </p>          <p>The fact that the <u><b>growth rate is not a constant</b></u> is             a significant theoretical source of error.</p>          <p>If <b>&micro;</b> were constant and <b>p(t) = p0*e^&micro;*t</b>,             then finding the doubling time <b>Td</b> would simple. </p>          <p><b>Td</b> would equal the time<b> t</b> when <b>p(t) = 2p0</b>.</p>          <p align="right"> Set <b>p(t) = 2*p0</b> and solve for <b>t</b>.</p>          <p align="right"><b>p0*e^&micro;*t = 2*p0</b></p>          <p align="right"><b>e^&micro;*t = 2 </b></p>          <p align="right"> <b>&micro; * t = ln 2</b></p>          <p align="center"><b>t = ln 2/&micro;</b></p>          <p>If you know <b>&micro;</b>, the calculation is simple. </p>          <p>To estimate <b>&micro;</b>, consider our model: </p>          <p align="right"><b>p(t) = p0*e^&micro;*t</b></p>          <p align="right">ln p(t) <b>= ln(p0) + &micro;*t </b></p>          <p>ln p(t) is a linear function of t, with slope <b>&micro;</b> and             Y-intercept ln p0.</p>          <p>By plotting your data on semi-log paper, you can avoid calculating             the logs of the data points. </p>          <hr>          <p><b>But wait!</b> We do not have a direct measurement of the biomass             concentration; all the spectrophotometer gives us is a measurement             of absorbance (<b>A</b>). </p>          <p>Here we encounter another simplifying, but not strictly accurate,             assumption; namely that the <b>A</b> of the culture is directly proportional             to the bacterial biomass:</p>          <p> <b>p(t) = kA(t)</b>, where <b>A(t)</b> is the absorbance at time<b>             t</b>, and <b>k</b> is constant. </p>          <p>If this assumption were exact, <b>A</b> would double as the population             doubled. If you plotted<b> A</b> versus<b> t</b> on semilog paper,             and the population was actually growing exponentially you would get             a straight line</p>          <p align="right"><b><a href="LSL.htm">Do you understand least squares?             ask your vTA</a></b></p>          <p>described by the equation </p>          <p align="center">ln p(t) = ln k*A(t) = ln(k) +ln A(t) </p>          <p>that is, natural log of the absorbance values are related to the             natural log of the population value translated in the &quot;y' direction             by ln k. </p>          <p>It must therefore be the case that the least squares fit line for             the absorbance points has the same slope as the least squares fit             line for the population point set. </p>          <p>This slope is <b>&micro;</b>, the quantity we need.</p>          <p>Unfortunately, at high biomass concentrations the relationship between             <b>A</b> and biomass concentration is <u>not linear</u>, because of             the rescattering of light and interactions between cells.
