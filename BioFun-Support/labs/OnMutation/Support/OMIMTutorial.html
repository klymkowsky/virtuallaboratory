What you get is what you look for. The more specific your                 request, the more likely you will find exactly what you want.                 Get too specific, and you may not find anything. </td>            </tr>          </table>          <p>When you search OMIM you can retrieve genes and their descriptions             or specific genetic diseases. </p>          <p>Take our current example, chaperones and human disease. If you search             using just &quot;<b>chaperone</b>&quot; you will get back oa list             of every gene that has been implicated as a chaperone, as well as             genes whose products are known to interact with chaperones. You can             make your search more specific by adding a word. </p>          <p>For example, searching for &quot;<b>disease</b> <b>chaperone</b>&quot;             your list is greatly reduced. But if you searched for &quot;<b>disease</b>             <b>chaperone</b> <b>groEL</b>&quot; you would get nothing (or at least             I did when I tried it). </p>          <hr>          <p>When you see a chaperone-based disease that interests you, you may             want to explore it further by following the literature reference links.</p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>      </tr>    </table>    <p align=left><a href="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/Support/04.html" target="_parent"></a><a href="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/Support/05.html" target="_parent"><b>       <img src="/Biofundamentals/labs/commonGraphics/ArrowLEFT.GIF" width="36" height="36" border="0"></b></a></p></blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
