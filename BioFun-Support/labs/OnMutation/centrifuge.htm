If it             is denser, it will sink. Centrifugation simply speeds the sinking             process. </p>          <p>Bacterial cells are denser than standard growth media. If a culture             of bacteria is left on the bench top undisturbed, the bacteria will             fall out of solution (they will sediment). </p>          <p>The rate of sedimentation is determined by the difference in the             object's density compared to the density of the medium and the earth's             gravitational field. </p>          <p>The rate of sedimentation will also be influenced by its size. </p>          <p>A small particle, such as a phage, will remain in suspension (even             though it is even denser that a bacterium), due to Brownian effects             (first discovered by <a href="http://www.sciences.demon.co.uk/wbbrowna.htm" target="_new"><b>Robert             Brown in 1827</b> </a>and explained in molecular terms by <b>Albert             Einstein in 1905</b>. </p>          <p>The constant jostling of the surrounding molecules is enough to overcome             the effects of gravity, and keep phage suspended in solution. </p>          <p>To overcome these Brownian effects, and speed the process of sedimentation,             we can increase the effective gravitation field by using a centrifuge.           </p>          <p>A typical laboratory centrifuge produces a centrifugal force of ~10,000g.             More specialized (and rather more expensive) instruments can produce             centrifugal forces of up to ~600,000g.</p>          <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>        <td bordercolor="#999999" width="46%">           <p align="right"><a href="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/Support/04.html" target="_parent"></a>The equation             describing sedimentation rate is </p>          <p align="right">n = d^2 (po-pm) x g/18n</p>          <p align="right">where n is the sedimentation rate<br>            d is a function of particle size and shape<br>            po is the density of the particle<br>            pm is the density of the medium<br>            g is the strength of the gravitational/centrifugal field<br>            n is the viscosity of the medium.</p>          <p align="right">The effective centrifugal field is a function of the             diameter of the centrifuge's rotor and the speed at which it spins.           </p>          <p align="right">Depending upon the situation, particles can be separated             on the basis of size (and to some extent shape), density, or a combination             of both.</p>          <hr>          <p>In our studies, we exploit the size different between an intact bacterium,             a T4 phage, and the subcellular debris that remains after cell lysis.           </p>          <p>A short 5 minute centrifugation at 5,000 g in a table top centrifuge             is enough to pellet intact bacteria, and leave phage in solution.           </p>          <p>A longer spin of 10 minutes at 10,000 g will remove most cellular             debris, while leaving the phage in solution. </p>          <p>T4 phage are large and they can be pelleted by centrifugation, but             this takes ~20 minutes at 35,000g</p>          </td>      </tr>    </table>    <p align=left><a href="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/Support/04.html" target="_parent"></a><a href="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/Support/04.html" target="_parent"><b><img src="../../../../firstSeries/OnMutation/commonGraphics/ArrowLEFT.GIF" width="36" height="36"></b></a></p></blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
