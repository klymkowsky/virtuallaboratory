            process.&nbsp; First <span class="style3">we guess it</span>.&nbsp; Then we compute the
              consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this
              law that we guessed is right.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style4">Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with
              experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation,
              to see if it works.&nbsp; If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong.&nbsp; In that simple
              statement is the key to science.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style5">It does not make any difference how beautiful your
              guess is.&nbsp; It
              does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess,
              or what his name is &ndash; if it disagrees with experiment it
              is wrong.&nbsp; That is all there is to it.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="style4">It is true that
              one has to check a little to make sure that it is wrong,
              because whoever did the experiment may have reported incorrectly,
              or there may have been some feature in the experiment that was
              not noticed, some dirt or something; or the man who computed the
              consequences, even though it may have been the one who made the
              guesses, could have made some mistakes in the analysis.&nbsp; These
              are obvious remarks, so when I say if it disagrees with experiment
              it is wrong, I mean after the experiment has been checked, the
              calculations have been checked, and the thing has been rubbed back
              and forth a few times to make sure that the consequences are logical
              consequences from the guess, and that in fact it disagrees with
              a very carefully checked experiment.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="style4"> This [analysis] will give you a somewhat wrong impression of
              science.&nbsp; It suggests that we keep on guessing possibilities
              and comparing them with experiment, and this is to put experiment
              into a rather weak position.&nbsp; In fact experimenters have a
              certain individual character.&nbsp; They like to do experiments
              even if nobody has guessed yet, and they very often do their experiments
              in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any
              guesses.&nbsp; &hellip;</p>
            <p class="style4">You can see, of course, that with this method <strong>we
                can attempt to disprove any definite theory</strong>.&nbsp; If we have a definite theory,
              a real guess, from which we can conveniently compute consequences
              which can be compared with experiment, then in principle we can
              get rid of any theory.&nbsp; There is always the possibility of
              proving any definite theory wrong; but notice that we can never
              prove it right.&nbsp; Suppose that you invent a good guess, calculate
              the consequences, and discover every time that the consequences
              you have calculated agree with experiment.&nbsp; The theory is
              then right?&nbsp; No, it is simply not proved wrong.&nbsp; &hellip;<br>
