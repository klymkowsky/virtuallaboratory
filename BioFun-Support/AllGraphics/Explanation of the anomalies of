<br>
In
    <a href="ice1h.html">ice (1h)</a>, all water molecules participate in four hydrogen bonds (two as donor and two
    as acceptor) and are held relatively static. In liquid water, some hydrogen
    bonds must be broken to allow the molecules move around. The large energy
    required for breaking these bonds must be supplied during the melting
    process and only a relatively minor amount of energy is reclaimed from the
    change in volume. The free energy change (</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">G=</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">H-T</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">S)
    must be zero at the melting point. As temperature is increased, the amount
    of hydrogen bonding in liquid water decreases and its entropy increases. Melting will
    only occur when there is sufficient entropy change to provide the energy
    required for the bond breaking. The low entropy (high organization) of liquid water causes this
    melting point to be high. [<a href="anmlies.html#1">Back</a>]</font>

    &nbsp;<br>
    There is
considerable hydrogen bonding in liquid water which prevents water molecules
from being easily released from the water's surface. This reduces the vapor pressure. Boiling cannot occur until this
vapor pressure equals the external pressure. This occurs at a consequentially
higher temperature. [<a href="anmlies.html#2">Back</a>]</font>

    The
critical point can only be reached when the interactions between the water
molecules fall below a certain threshold level. Due to the strength and extent
of the hydrogen bonding, much energy is needed to cause this reduction in
molecular interaction and this requires higher temperatures. Even close to the critical point, a considerable number of
hydrogen bonds remain, albeit bent, elongated and no longer tetrahedrally
arranged [<a href="ref.html#92">92</a>]. [<a href="anmlies.html#3">Back</a>]</font>

    &nbsp;<br>
    Water
    molecules at the liquid surface are pulled laterally and towards the bulk by the remaining
    hydrogen bonds. Energy is required to increase the surface area, so it
    is minimized and held under tension. As the forces between the water molecules are several and
    relatively large on a per-mass basis, compared to those between most other
    molecules, the surface tension is large. Lowering the temperature greatly
    increases the hydrogen bonding causing increased surface tension. [<a href="anmlies.html#4">Back</a>]</font>

    The
    viscosity of a liquid is determined by the ease with which molecules can
    move relative to each other. It depends on the forces holding the molecules
    together. This cohesivity is large in water due to its extensive
three-dimensional hydrogen
    bonding. It should be noted that although the viscosity is high, it is not so high that it causes too
much difficulty being moved around within organisms. [<a href="anmlies.html#5">Back</a>]</font></p>

<br>
There is still
    considerable hydrogen bonding (~75%) in water at 100ÉC.
    As effectively all these bonds need to be broken (very few indeed remaining
    in the gas phase), there is
    a great deal of energy required to convert the water to gas, where the water
    molecules are effectively separated. The increased hydrogen bonding at lower
temperatures causes higher heats of vaporization (e.g. 44.8 kJ/mol, at 0ÉC). The high heat of vaporization also
    causes water to have an anomalously low ebullioscopic constant (i.e. effect
    of solute on boiling point elevation, 0.51 K
    kg/mol, c.f. CCl<sub>4 </sub>4.95 K kg/mol). Water also has an anomalously
    high entropy of vaporization (109 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>, cf.
Trouton's constant 85 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>)<sup> </sup>due to the additional hydrogen-bonded order
    lost on vaporization. [<a href="anmlies.html#6">Back</a>]</font>

    The

    efficiency where all the water molecules are involved in four straight tetrahedrally-oriented
    hydrogen bonds; for comparison, solid hydrogen sulfide has
    a face centered cubic closed packed structure with each molecule having
    twelve nearest
    neighbors [<a href="ref.html#119">119</a>]. On melting, some of these <a href="ice1h.html">ice (1h)</a> 
    bonds break,
    others bend and the structure undergoes a partial collapse. This is
    different from what happens with most solids, where the extra movement
    available in the liquid phase requires more space and therefore melting is
    accompanied by expansion. [<a href="anmlies.html#7">Back</a>]</font>

    &nbsp;<br>
    The high density of liquid water is due mainly to the
    cohesive nature of the hydrogen-bonded network. This reduces the free volume
    and ensures a relatively high density, more than compensating for the
    partial open nature of the hydrogen-bonded network. The anomalous temperature-density
    behavior of water can be
explained as previously [<a href="ref.html#13" name="13">13</a>, <a href="ref.html#14" name="14"> 14</a>] utilizing the
range of environments within whole or partially formed clusters with differing
degrees of dodecahedral puckering. The density maximum is brought about by the
opposing effects of increasing temperature, causing both structural collapse
that increases density and thermal expansion that lowers density. At lower
temperatures there is a higher concentration of <a href="clusters.html#ES">ES</a>
    whereas at higher
temperatures there is more <a href="clusters.html#CS">CS</a> and fragments, but
    the volume they occupy expands with temperature. The change from
    <a href="clusters.html#ES">ES</a>
    to <a href="clusters.html#CS">CS</a> as the temperature rises is accompanied by positive changes in entropy
and enthalpy due to the less ordered structure and greater hydrogen bond bending respectively.

<a name="neigmelt"></a>The number of nearest neighbors increases on melting</b>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Each
water molecule in <a href="ice1h.html">hexagonal ice</a> has four nearest neighbors. On melting, the partial collapse of the open hydrogen bonded network allows unbonded molecules
to approach more closely so increasing this number.
Normally in a liquid the movement of molecules, and the extra space they find themselves in, means that it becomes less likely that they will be
found close to each other; e.g. argon has exactly twelve nearest neighbors in the
solid state but only an average of about ten on melting. [<a href="anmlies.html#9">Back</a>]</font></p>

<a name="neig"></a>Nearest neighbors increase with temperature</b>
<br>
If
a water molecule is in a fully hydrogen-bonded structure with strong and
straight hydrogen bonds (such as <a href="ice1h.html">hexagonal ice</a>) then it
will only have four nearest neighbors. In the liquid phase, molecules approach more closely
due to the partial collapse of the open hydrogen bonded network. As the temperature of liquid water
increases, the continuing collapse of the hydrogen bonded network allows unbonded molecules
to approach more closely so increasing the number of nearest neighbors. This is
in contrast to normal liquids where the increasing kinetic energy of molecules and space available due to
expansion, as the
temperature is raised, means that it becomes less likely that molecules will be
found close to each other. [<a href="anmlies.html#10">Back</a>]</font>

    <a name="Pmelt"></a>Pressure reduces

<br>
Increasing
pressure normally promotes liquid freezing, shifting the the melting point to
higher temperatures. This is shown by the forward sloping liquid/solid
line in the phase diagram. In water, <a href="phase.html">this line </a>is
backward sloping. As the pressure increases, the water <a href="clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a>
shifts towards a collapsed structure (e.g. <a href="clusters.html#ES">CS</a> )
with higher entropy. This lowers the melting free energy change (</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">G=</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">H-T</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">S)

<a name="Pdens"></a>Pressure reduces

<br>
Increasing
pressure shifts the water <a href="clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a>
towards a more collapsed structure (e.g. <a href="clusters.html#ES">CS</a> ). So
although pressure will increase the density of water at all temperatures
(flattening the temperature density curve), it will have a disproportionate
effect at lower temperatures. The result is a shift in the temperature of maximum
density to lower temperatures. At high enough pressures the density maximum is shifted
to below 0ÉC and, at above
200 MPa, it cannot be observed. A similar effect may be caused by increasing salt
concentration, which behaves like <a href="hofmeist.html#pressure">increased
pressure </a>in breaking up the low density clusters. Thus in 0.36 Molal NaCl the temperature of freezing and maximum density coincide at -1.33ÉC.

 Viscous flow occurs by molecules moving through the
    voids that exist between them. As the pressure increases, the volume
    decreases and the volume of these voids reduces, so normally increasing the
    viscosity. Water's pressure-viscosity behavior can be explained by
the increased pressure causing deformation, so reducing the strength of the
hydrogen-bonded network, which is also partially responsible for the viscosity. This
    reduction in cohesivity more than compensates for the reduced void volume. [<a href="anmlies.html#15">Back</a>]</font>

    &nbsp;<br>
    It may be thought that water should have a high
compressibility as the <a href="bits.html#Fig3"> large cavities</a> in
    liquid water allows plenty of scope for the water structure to collapse
    under pressure without water molecules approaching close enough to repel
    each other. The deformation causes the

pressure [<a href="ref.html#51" name="51">51</a>] (and temperature [<a href="ref.html#50" name="50">50</a>]), due to the collapsing structure. The low compressibility of water is due to
water's high density, again due to the cohesive nature of the extensive
hydrogen bonding holding. This reduces the free space (compared with other
liquids) to a greater extent than
the contained cavities increase it. [<a href="anmlies.html#16">Back</a>]</font>

    <br>
    In a typical
liquid the compressibility decreases as the
structure becomes more compact due to lowered temperature. In water, the cluster <a href="clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a>
shifts towards the more open structure (e.g. <a href="clusters.html#ES">ES</a> )
as the temperature is reduced due to it favoring the more ordered structure (</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">G

temperatures, the capacity for it to be compressed increases. The effect is not
a simple dependency on density, however, or else the the minimum at 46.5ÉC would be at
    the density minimum (4ÉC).
Compressibility depends on fluctuations in the specific volume and these will be
large where water molecules fluctuate between being associated, or not, with a
more open structure and between the different environments within the water
clusters. [<a href="anmlies.html#17">Back</a>]</font>

    Sound is a longitudinal pressure wave, whereby the energy is propagated as
    deformations in the media but the molecules then return to their original
    positions and are not propagated. The propagation of
a sound wave depends on the transfer of vibration from one molecule to another.
The speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the compressibility
times density term. The anomalous nature of both these physical properties are
described above (<a href="#Tcomp">compressibility</a>, <a href="#density">density</a>).
At low temperatures both compressibility and density are high, so causing a lower
speed of sound. As the temperature increases the compressibility drops and goes
through a minimum whereas the density goes through a maximum and then drops.
Combination of these two properties leads to the maximum in the speed of sound.

<a name="2Cpt"></a>Supercooled water has two phases and a
    <a href="data.html#Second critical point"> second critical point</a> at
-45ÉC</b>
    &nbsp;<br>
As
water is supercooled it converts mainly into its expanded form (e.g. <a href="clusters.html#ES">ES</a> ) at ambient pressures, which at low
enough temperatures (&lt; -38ÉC) may result in it
forming low density amorphous ice (LDA; although normally it will form <a href="ice1h.html">hexagonal
ice</a> at this temperature). If the pressure on LDA is increased
above about 200 MPa then LDA undergoes a 30% collapse forming high density
amorphous ice (HDA). This <a href="phase.html"> phase change</a> cannot continue to higher temperatures
(so creating a <a href="phase.html">second critical point</a>, [<a href="ref.html#45" name="45">45</a>])
as neither of these phases is stable in the presence of liquid water although
they may convert into their metastable supercooled liquid forms. [<a href="anmlies.html#28">Back</a>]</font>

    As
water is cooled, the cluster <a href="clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a>
shifts towards the more open structure (e.g. <a href="clusters.html#ES">ES</a> ).
In order for crystallization to occur 3 - 4 unit cells worth of water molecules
have to come together in the correct orientation. The formation of icosahedral
clusters interferes with this process whilst not allowing cluster crystallization
due to their five fold symmetry. Lowering the temperature further, which should
encourage crystallization, is partially counteracted by the increase in
icosahedral clustering. [<a href="anmlies.html#29">Back</a>]</font>

    The
ability for water to form extensive networks of hydrogen bonds increases the <a href="phase.html">number

ice</a>  (19.65 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol.), which contains only about 7.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol
of water molecules, gives plenty of scope for different arrangements of the water molecules
as the structure is compressed. For comparison, hydrogen sulfide has only four
distinct solid phases [<a href="ref.html#119" name="119">119</a>]. [<a href="anmlies.html#30">Back</a>]
