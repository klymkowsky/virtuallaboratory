Hand as described in theBook of Genesis over the course of six literal days beginning at 9:00 A.M.on October 23 in 4004 B.C.E.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine this fellow then tellingyou that in the 22nd century B.C.E. a man named Noah in anticipation ofThe Great Flood built a large ark from gopher wood; that he and his familycollected representatives from each of several million living species offlora and fauna (including bacteria, cacti, kangaroos, blue whales, penguins,polar bears, dinosaurs and the AIDS virus) and placed them in this ark;that after forty days and forty nights of Very Heavy Rain and a year afloat,the ark then ran aground on a mountaintop in the Middle East and then eachof the plants and animals somehow managed to transport themselves to theirrespective continent(s).&nbsp; Then he informs you that all 5.2 billionhumans on earth today are descended from those persons who were aboardthe ark about 4000 years ago. You look puzzled as this fellow continuesto maintain his serious expression.&nbsp; Finally, he says that he callsthis account of origins Creation Science, and</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>that he believes God wants him to bring this 'explanation'into the science classrooms of schools all over the world. It soon becomesapparent that this is no joke.&nbsp; Seventy years have passed since theinfamous Scopes 'Monkey Trial' in Dayton, Tennessee, yet the above 'imagined'scenario is a reasonable representation of what is happening today in theU.S.A. and, to a lesser extent (for now), Canada. It is the purpose ofthis paper to introduce the reader to the creation/evolution controversyand to discuss its implications for education in Ontario and abroad.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="What is"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What is Creation 'Science'?</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Creation 'Science,' that notorious oxymoron, is acomponent of Christian fundamentalism which -- with the tenacity of a pious,myopic pit-bull -- adheres to a doctrine of Biblical inerrancy (i.e. literalism)and growls that Biblical views must be taught in all school subjects, particularlyscience.&nbsp;&nbsp; So tenaciously do these Creationists hold to theirliteral interpretation of the Bible that some will assure you that grasshoppershave 4 legs, that the Earth is flat, that all space flight has been hoaxed,that the Sun orbits the stationary Earth, and that rabbits are ruminants,since the Bible describes each of these matters thus, and the Bible isan "all or nothing" document.&nbsp; The Creationists believe that 'true'Christians must hold such things as literal truths lest they run the riskof taking certain other, more critical, Biblical passages metaphorically,leading, ultimately, to the unraveling of their beloved fundamentalism.Figurative interpretation of selected verses does not present a difficultyfor most Christians, but, to the Creationist's way of thinking, non-literalinterpretation is the death knell of Faith. It is precisely this loss ofFaith, alleged to have been caused by the proliferation of 'evolutionarythought,' that the Creationists hold responsible for all of the evils ofthe world, including "sex education, alcohol, suicide, women's liberation,terrorism, homosexuality, inflation, socialism, racism and dirty books"[1]. Judge Braswell Dean, a Georgia lobbyist for Creationism, lays an equallycomprehensive spectrum of crimes on the doorstep of evolution (and pullsno alliterative punches in doing so): <B><FONT COLOR="#FF1E21">...thismonkey mythology of Darwin is the cause of abortions, permissiveness, promiscuity,perversions, pregnancies, prophylactics, pornotherapy, pollution, poisoningand proliferation of crimes of all types.</FONT></B> [2]&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Strangely, many of these woes have existedlong before Charles Darwin's 1859 publication of The Origin of Species.Perhaps the Judge might suggest that advance copies of Darwin's book weresomehow presented to pre-nineteenth century wrongdoers by Satan himself.&nbsp;Creationist institutes exist in several countries including the U.S.A.,Canada and Australia.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Several of them are listed:</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 1. The Institute for Creation Research (foundedin 1970, in San Diego, CA.&nbsp; by Henry M. Morris)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 2. Christian Heritage College (founded in1970, in the foothills of El Cajon, a suburb of San Diego)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 3. The Creation-Science Research Center (alsofounded in 1970 in San Diego, by Nell Segraves)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 4. The Creation Research Society (foundedin 1963, in Ann Arbour,Michigan, by ten Creation Scientists)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 5. The Creation Science Association of Canada(founded in 1967, in Vancouver, B.C.)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 6. The Creation Science Association of Alberta(a registered charitable organization whose primary objective is "to promotethe inclusion of scientific creationism in school curricula.")</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; 7. The Creation Science Association of Ontario(Scarborough, Ontario)</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Many of these institutes devote some timeto writing loosely scientific articles for creationist publications. Theyspend much more time, however, giving presentations at churches, highschoolsand universities on "the scientific evidence for Creation." They also carryout 'research.' This 'research' almost exclusively consists of the scouringof scientific publications for quotes from prominant evolutionists whichcould be lifted from their original context and then perversely recontextualizedin order to serve Creationist purposes. (Aside: Don Patton, a Texas Creationist,came to do a three-day lecture series in November of 1994 at McMaster University,Hamilton, Ontario. I attended the event and tape recorded it. The bulkof the 'scientific lectures' consisted of a collage of these greatly recycledout-of-context quotations from prominent evolutionists such as StephenJay Gould. Patton euphemistically refers to this approach as the "HostileWitness."&nbsp; This tactic has angered many of their targetted scientists[3, pp. 34-44].) The closest that these Creationist institutes have cometo performing legitimate research was to carry out several expeditionsto Mount Ararat, Turkey, in search of Noah's ark. Still no sign of thegopher-wood zoo-boat [4, pp. 97-101, 187-195].</FONT></CENTER><CENTER>&nbsp;<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="Religion?"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Creationism: Religionor Science?</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Thirty years ago, Creation Scientists called themselvesCreation Evangelists and they proudly preached the 'Creationist Gospel.'Since then, the&nbsp; Creationists have become much more sophisticatedin their approach and have&nbsp; had the word 'evangelist' replaced withthe word 'scientist.' However, just as a rose by any other name would smellas sweet, the stinkweed of Creationism remains rank. This strategic changein nomenclature was necessary in order to sugar-coat the doctrine of Biblicalfundamentalism so that it would seem more palatable to those school andgovernment officials who have the power to allow Creationist dogma intoa science classroom.&nbsp; Now, what of the scientific merits of Creation'Science'? One must assess this question before deciding whether or notCreationism belongs in science classes. Creation 'Science' offers noneof the explanatory or predictive capability of the theory of evolution,and provides no new insights into any of the questions which evolution(or any other science) is presently unable to answer. What the Creationistspresent as science is in fact pseudoscience, much like palmistry, astrologyand the alchemy of old. As a scientific alternative to evolution, Creationismis a dismal failure.&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>It is, therefore, our unequivocal conclusionthat creationism, with its</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accounts of the origin oflife by supernatural means, is not science. [5]&nbsp; Furthermore, Creationismdoes not fare much better as a religion. Many Christian thinkers find theCreationist brand of fundamentalist na&iuml;vit&eacute; embarassing atbest, and, at worst, damaging to the whole of Christendom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible danger is that in presenting the gospel to the lost andin defending God's truth we ourselves will seem to be false. It is&nbsp;time for Christian people to recognize that the defense of this modern,&nbsp;young-Earth, Flood-geology creationism is simply not truthful. It is simplynot in accord with the facts that God has given. Creationism must be abandonedby Christians before harm is done. The persistent attempt of the creationistmovement to get their points of view established in educational institutionscan only bring harm to the Christian cause. Can we seriously expect non-Christianeducational&nbsp; leaders to develop a respect for Christianity if we insiston teaching&nbsp; the brand of science that creationism brings with it?Will not the&nbsp; forcing of modern creationism on the public simply lendcredence to the&nbsp; idea already entertained by so many intellectualleaders that Christianity, at least in its modern form, is sheer anti-intellectual&nbsp;obscurantism? I fear that it will.

However,a quick word regarding the strategy of the Creationist attack will givethe reader a good whiff of the intellectual integrity of the underpinningsof Creation 'Science.'&nbsp; The most effective Creationist tactic hasbeen to prey upon the ignorance of the general public in regards to thingsscientific. On this matter the renowned science and science fiction writer-- the late, great <B><FONT COLOR="#FF160F">Isaac Asimov</FONT></B> --lamented that&nbsp;&nbsp; "<FONT COLOR="#FF1414">...it is precisely becauseit is fashionable for Americans [and Canadians, doubtless] to know no science,even though they may be well educated otherwise, that they so easily fallprey to nonsense. They thus become part of the armies of the night, thepurveyors of nitwittery, the retailers of intellectual junk food, the feederson mental cardboard, for their ignorance keeps them from distinguishingnectar from sewage. </FONT>[8, p. 210].&nbsp;&nbsp;<HR WIDTH="100%">The Creationist battle cry can be stated thus: Publicignorance is Creationist bliss.&nbsp; The most ubiquitous and most thoroughlyexploited element of scientific illiteracy has been -- and continues tobe -- the misunderstanding of the word 'theory.' Creationists, in theirpublic presentations and in their literature, invariably describe evolutionas being 'only' a theory.&nbsp; Colloquially, the word 'theory' has cometo mean 'guess,' and, well aware of this misconception, the Creationistsdemand that their 'guess' regarding origins be given 'equal time' in anyclassroom that mentions the theory of evolution -- all ostensibly in thespirit of fair play and democracy. 'Equal time' is what they are demandingtoday. They are well aware that any attempt to completely eradicate evolutionfrom textbooks would fail. In other words, this business about 'equal time'is only a matter of political expediency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>What, exactly, is the Creationist understanding ofthe word 'theory'?</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Certainly they would not object to the teaching ofmusic theory for the</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>reason that it is only a theory. They would not daredeny the existence of music. Similarly, Newton's Laws of gravity and motionare also just as 'theoretical' as evolution (though they are called 'laws'because the word 'law' was more fashionable in Newton's day), but no Creationistwould deny the existence of gravity. They are only interested in belittlingthose fields of science that threaten their doctrine of Biblical inerrancy.&nbsp;So, then, what is the proper definition of a scientific 'theory'? It isthis: a theory is a set of ideas that describes and/or explains a phenomenon.Karl Popper, perhaps this century's most renowned philosopher of science,arrived at the most universally accepted criterion: a theory must be falsifiable.A theory also must have predictive powers. The theory of evolution satisfiesboth of these criteria; Creationist 'theory' satisfies neither. It containsits conclusion in its premise, i.e., that our origins are as describedin the Book of Genesis, verbatim, and, consequently, scientific observationsmust either be twisted or ignored accordingly.&nbsp; Creation 'Science'has no scientific content whatever, despite Creationist protests to thecontrary, and, therefore, it has no place in a science class. However,it somehow still manages to infiltrate the schools, as we shall see.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="classroom"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Creationism in the Classroom</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#FF231E">Henry M.

In fact, Creationism is being taught at several schoolsacross Canada, some of which are in Ontario [11].</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="scopes"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>'Scopes II'</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>In some cases where definitive decisions have yetto be made, Canadian courts will follow the American lead [12, p. 92].For this reason, it is well worth examining a particularly relevant Americancourt case. Perhaps the best known legal battle involving the Creationists'attempt to infiltrate the classroom in recent history began in Arkansasat the end of 1981. Penned as 'Scopes II,' this court case was a resultof the state of Arkansas' passing of a bill requiring state schools togive "balanced treatment" to both evolution and "scientific creationism."The law was to take effect in the 1982-83 school year, and covered alleducational materials and programs that dealt in any way with the subjectof the origin of man, life, energy, the earth, or the universe. GovernorFrank White, who -- by his own admission -- did not even read the bill,signed it. Thus was Act 590 born. The Act drew immediate opposition fromthe American Civil Liberties Union on the grounds that it violated thefirst amendment.&nbsp; Interestingly, most of the twenty-three plaintiffswere actually clergymen who viewed Act 590 as a threat to religious freedom.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>The case came to court in Little Rock, Arkansas withfederal Judge William R. Overton presiding. The ACLU fought its case onthe grounds that Creationism is religious, not scientific, and that itsteaching would therefore violate Constitutional separation of church andstate as well as the academic freedom of both teachers and students. Localscience teachers testified that they had no idea how a sensible coursecombining Creationism with evolution could be designed, and if forced toteach both, would be at a loss as to how to proceed [13, pp. 71-74].&nbsp;On January 5, 1982 Judge Overton ruled that Arkansas Law 590 violated theprinciple of separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution.&nbsp;He declared that it represented nothing more than a transparent attemptto introduce the Biblical version of Creation into the public schools.He also ruled that Creationism is not science, and that evolution is notreligion (as the defense had insisted). Furthermore, even if evolutionwas a religion, then the proper course of action would be to cease teachingevolution in public schools, not to begin teaching another religion inopposition to it [14, p. 59].&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the Creationists neverwin any major battles in court, they could&nbsp; significantly affect thequality of science education at the local level.&nbsp; The pressure takesthe form of subtle intimidation of teachers with the result that many treadvery lightly around evolution to avoid controversy. This is a part of therationale for the Creationist 'road shows': to foster a bottom-up, grassrootsmovement.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="In Canada"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>In Canada</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>The Creation Science Association of Canada is responsiblefor most of the strides that Creationism has made in this country. Oneof their</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>accomplishments is a 13,000-name petition sent tothe (former) Minister of Education for Ontario, Dr. Bette Stephenson, callingfor Creation 'Science' to be included in all textbooks, school courses,and museums where evolution is espoused [15, p. 5]. It also sent a 7,500-namepetition to the Minister of Education in British Columbia demanding equaltime for Creationism in the&nbsp;&nbsp; Science program. The B.C. Ministerconceded that it might be beneficial to&nbsp; teach both views, and someschool districts now teach Creationism along with science [16, p. 23].In Canada, generally, the Provincial Ministries of&nbsp; Education havenot defined any specific policy with respect to Creationism,&nbsp; so thatit is neither on the curricula nor off. As a result, it is possible&nbsp;that Creationism may be taught in schools wherever there are teachers withCreationist beliefs, though not necessarily with the endorsement of theMinistries. For example, in 1982 Quest magazine reported that the presidentof CSAC, a teacher of biology and chemistry at Burnaby South Senior SecondarySchool in Burnaby, B.C., taught Creationism unchallenged for many years.It reported as well that a director of the Ontario chapter of the CreationScience Association, who teaches biology at North Park Secondary Schoolin Brampton, Ontario, has taught 'Scientific' Creationism in the schoolfor years [16, p.23].&nbsp; In the Ontario Ministry of Education's Intermediate/SeniorScience Curriculum Guideline (from 1985, but I suspect that more recentguidelines also adhere to this policy) it is recommended that if the materialbeing studied in a particular unit is felt by the student or his or herfamily to be incompatible with deeply-held religious beliefs, the studentmay be excused from that portion of the course alternative project of equivalenteducational value and an alternative project of equivalent educationalvalue should be supplied for that student.</FONT><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Could the "alternative project of equivalent educationalvalue" involve Creation 'Science'? From a scientific perspective, absolutelynot. However, in the political interests of the powers that be, the answeris likely a timid "o.k." It is also recommended that evolution be presentedas providing "only one set of insights as to the origin of life on earth,"and that "other fields of study such as religion, philosophy and astronomyinfluence personal hypotheses on the origin of the universe and the lifein it." (Exactly how astronomy can conflict with evolution is unknown tome.)&nbsp; Nowhere in the Guideline is Creationism explicitly mentioned,but clearly, it is Ministry policy to handle it with care [13, pp. 65-66].Regulation 298, section 28(2), of the Ontario Education Act has some bearingon this matter. It states that if a school board decides to provide a courseabout religion, then the program of education must (a) promote respectfor the freedom of conscience and religion guaranteed by the Canadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms; and (b) provide for the study of different religionsand religious beliefs in Canada and the world, without giving primacy to,and without indoctrination in, any particular religion and religious belief.Creation 'Science' would violate both of these conditions.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="Academic Freedom"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Academic Freedom</FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Some might argue that the disallowance of a scienceteacher (with</FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Creationist inclinations) to teach Creation 'Science'in a science classroom is in violation of the teacher's academic freedom.This is not so. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0F11">Proudfoot and Hutchings</FONT></B>write in their book, Teacher Beware, that <FONT COLOR="#FF1B11">"...theymust not promote their own beliefs and opinions to the&nbsp; exclusionof others, particularly when their beliefs do not conform to the approvedcurriculum.

As one educator has put it,"Why should we teach levitation in a pilot training course? Why shouldwe teach the "Stork Theory" in a sex education class?"&nbsp; Left unchecked,Creation 'Science' will damage public perceptions of both Christianityand science. In a way that Charles Darwin never could, Creation 'Science'has the potential to make monkeys of us all.</FONT></CENTER><CENTER>&nbsp;<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><CENTER><A NAME="Biblio"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bibliography</FONT></B></CENTER>&nbsp; 1.
