<SECTION>Seth Wright
<ASK>1</ASK>
<MC>In 1791 Seth Wright discovered a short legged male in his flock of sheep.  How did he use this animal to "improve" his flock?
<I>It gave him the idea that he could keep normal sheep from escaping by building higher fences. </I>
<C>He bred the short-legged male with normal females, selected the short-legged offspring, and used them to establish a variety of short -legged sheep that could not jump over the fences of his neighbors. </C>
<I>He destroyed it, since short-legged sheep are less desireable than normal ones.</I>
<I>He told Charles Darwin, which inspired Darwin to devise his theory of evolution.</I>
</MC>
<MC>In the wild, what would be the likely fate of Seth Wright's short legged male sheep?
<ASIS>
<I>His short height would make it easier for him to hide from predators - it would increase his chances for survival.</I>
<I>His short legs would make him much slower in running, so he would have less chance to escape - it would decrease his chances of survival.</I>  
<I>Sheep eat grass, so his short legs would save him energy from bending his head to eat - he would therefore have more energy for reproduction. </I>
<I>His short legs would reduce his ability to see predators.  This would make him more vulnerable and less likely to survive.</I>
 <C>All of the above are potentially true - it would depend upon his environment whether the short legged trait was an advantage or a disadvantage.</C>

<I>B. allowing the flower to be fertilized by specially trained bees. </I>

<MC>In general, how can we tell the sex of an individual?

<MC>What does the term "monoecious" mean?
<I>each individual has one and only one sex.</I>
<I>each individual produces only sperm (pollen) or eggs, but not both.</I>
<I>the individual is sterile.</I>
<C>each individual produces both sperm (pollen) and eggs.</C>
</MC>
<MC>By controlled breeding of plants, Kolreuter  demonstrated that for most traits, 
<C>male and female contribute equally to the determination of the trait.</C>
<I>the male determines the nature of the trait.</I>
<I>the female determines the nature of the trait.</I>
<I>traits are determined primarily by the environment.</I>
</MC>
<MC>When Mendel crossed two of the inbred strains used in his study, he found that 
<I>the F1 individuals displayed a trait intermediate between the two parental traits.</I>
<C>the F1 individuals displayed one of the parental traits.</C>
<I>the F1 individuals displayed a new trait, quite different from either parental trait.</I>

<MC>What is an allele? 
<I>a gene.</I>
<C>one version of a gene.</C>
<I>the genotype of an organism.</I>

<I>it contains one copy of the gene.</I>
<C>it contains two identical alleles of the gene.</C>
<I>it contains two different alleles of the gene.</I>
<I>it does not contain the gene at all.</I>
<I>all organisms are homozygous, since all organisms of the same species have the same set of genes.</I>

<I>Alleles are linked together during gamete formation .</I>
<C>Alleles sort independently during gamete formation.</C>

<I>gemmules were influenced by the history of the organs they were derived from; genes are not.</I>
<I>gemmules have never been isolated; genes can be manipulated with modern molecular biological techniques.</I>
<I>gemmules were an ad hoc hypothesis to explain a rather mysterious process; the idea of the gene was based on the quantitative behavior of defined traits.</I>
