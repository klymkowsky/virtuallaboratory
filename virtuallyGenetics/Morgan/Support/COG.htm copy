      <p><font color="#FF0033"><b><font color="#666666">T-even phage behave differently 
        from many other phage, in that there is a strong &quot;lysis inhibition&quot; 
        associated with infection by multiple phage. </font></b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#666666"><b>This has an effect on plaque morphology - wild 
        type, r+ strains produce plaques with &quot;fuzzy&quot; boundaries. Why? 
        because at the edges of the plaque, many bacteria are infected by multiple 
        phage, which inhibits their lysis. </b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#666666"><b>The infected cell still dies, and virions are 
        still produced, but lysis does not occur efficiently, and when it does 
        occur can take quite some time.</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#666666"><b>This lysis inhibition is eliminated by mutations 
        designated &quot;r&quot;. Mutations in the &quot;r&quot; genes can be 
        readily identified through their effects on plaque morphology. r- mutant 
        phage produce clear plaques that are larger and have sharp edges. </b></font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
        of the T4 phage we are using in our experiments carry mutations in r.

      <p><b><font color="#666666">Seymour Benzer's analysis of mutations in the 
        r region were critical to our understanding of the nature of genes. </font></b></p>
