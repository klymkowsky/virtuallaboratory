By definition             they are not essential (if they were essential of bacterial survival             they would be considered chromosomes). </p>          <p>Plasmids contain the genetic elements required for their maintenaince             in the cell. There are low and high copy plasmids, which differ in             the number of copies were cell. There can be as many as 20 or more             copies of a high copy plasmid in a cell, and as few as 1 copy of a             low copy plasmid. </p>          <p>In addition to the genetic elements required for their maintanence,             plasmids can also carry genes that enhance the survival or pathogenicity             of the host bacterium.</p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>      </tr>    </table>    <p>The flexibiltiy of plasmids, in terms of size, has made them extremely       useful to microorganisms in the natural world, and to research scientists       in the human world. Plasmids can carry the genes responsible for antibiotic       resistance. Moreover, plasmid DNA can be picked up by cells through a process       known as transformation. This enables genetic traits to be transferred between       unrelated organisms -- a process known as horizontal gene transfer. </p>    <p>(The fact that you share genes with your parents and your children is an       example of vertical gene transfer). </p>    <p>Scientists have re-engineered plasmids to force bacterial cells to make       specific proteins. The evolutionary relatedness of all organisms is reflected       in the fact that genes from organisms as distinct as the potato and the       whale can be transcribed and translated into the correct proteins bacterial       and archeal cells (an amazing fact, if you think about it!). </p>    <p>return to your <a href="/library/Adaptation-I/06.html" target="_parent">adaptation       I</a></p>  </blockquote>  </blockquote></body></html>
