Good job you have isolated a lac -  mutant strain of  E. coli .  Now all you  need to do is to keep going until you have isolated five. Now all you need to do is to keep going until you have isolated five. We will label it lac     , and store it for further use. Remember that you are looking for colonies on the left-hand plate that  do not  have a replica colony growing on the lactose-deficient plate. Try  to pick a colony that does not overlap a colony with a twin on the  lactose minus plate; otherwise, you might end up with a sample that  contains both lac  and wild type bacteria. Now you must make sure that the colony you chose is actually a lac - strain.  If it is, the should be no bacteria growing on the right-hand plate. In this  case, choose any colony on the left, and use it to culture a strain.  If there are colonies growing on both plates, look one on the left-hand  plate that  does not  have a replica growing on the lactose-deficient plate.  Try to pick a colony that does not overlap a colony with a twin on the  lactose minus plate; otherwise, you might end up with a sample that  contains both lac- and wild type bacteria. If you cannot find such a  colony, start over with an entirely new pair of plates. Replica: lac - Click on a colony to sample it. Replica: lac - Click on a colony to sample it.

We will keep your  particular lac  mutant strains in storage. You will analyse them further  in future exercises. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=5,0,0,0" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=320> <PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="Repliplating_lac-.11.12.01.swf"> <PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high> <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#FFFFFF> <EMBED src="Repliplating_lac-.11.12.01.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFFF  WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=320 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></OBJECT></BODY></HTML>
