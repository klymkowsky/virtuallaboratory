  <p>Welcome</p>
  <p>Recently, the faculty of MCDB have return to requiring  Developmental Biology (<strong>DEVO</strong>) the capstone course for all MCDB majors. </p>
  <p>The goals of the course are to introduce you into the evolutionary logic together with the of both multicellularity and and Introduction to the course (rules, expectations &amp; such)</p>
  <p>How is the course grade determined? </p>
  <p>What is developmental biology and why does it matter? </p>
  <p>what to read for next class </p>
  <p><strong>activity 1: gene + molecule </strong></p>
  <p><span class="c1">A major tran</span><span class="c1"> are physicochemical systems whose history matters. Their   history,  shaped evolutionary processes over the course of billions of years, resulted in their  current structure and behaviors. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Even processes as amazing as dreaming and laughing are based on natural systems, and so can be studied</span> scientifically<span class="c1">.</span></p>
  <p>goal is to understanding what we can talk about without explanation, and what we cannot - BUT if something is said that you do not understand - please raise the point - we are no hurry to get through material&nbsp;- our goal is learning.  </p>
  <p>Similarly if a question arises for you, no matter apparently transcendental - please ask.<br>

<p>Different types of organisms, known as species, are defined as different by their "reproductive isolation" from one another. <br>

It is estimated that there are &gt; 1,500,000 (1.5 x 10<span class="c1"><sup>6</sup></span>) types of living organisms, of which ~750,000 are insects, ~250,000 are plants, and ~41,000 are vertebrates ("&gt;" means greater than, "~" means "approximately"). </p>

<p>Organisms <span class="c1">range from those consisting of a single-cell, known generically as microbes, to multicellular plants and animals that can contain over 10<sup>13</sup> distinct cells. </span></p>
<p class="c3">A particular type of organism can live independently or in communities, and different types of organisms live together in <strong>ecosystems</strong>. For example, microbes often live together in biofilms. Within a biofilm, organisms can cooperate or compete (or both) with one another in complex and evolving ways. In fact, some organisms are so co-dependent that we have yet to discover how to grow them in isolation from one another. </p>
<p class="c3">Right now, there are many microbes living within your gut, and together with you, they form an "enteric" ecosystem [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21787875" target="_blank">link</a>]. </p>
<p><span class="c1">The simplest form of multicellular organisms are colonies of related cells, held together in loose aggregates. </span>In these simple colonial organisms, all cells can reproduce.  </p>
<p>A major innovation in the history of life was the appearance of true multicellular organisms. Multicellular organisms are social organisms, different types of cells carry out different functions and only a small subset of cells, known as <strong>germ cells</strong>, give rise to the next generation of organisms. Other cells, known as <strong>somatic cells</strong>, form the body of the organism, and perform specific roles, but all somatic cells die when the organism dies. Social evolution involves what is known as "inclusive fitness".</p>
<p>In a multicellular organism, control of cellular behavior is critical and complex.  For example, when somatic cells begin to divide in an uncontrolled (anti-social) manner, the result is cancer. To guard against anti-social behavior, multicellular organisms (and social groups) use various strategies.  </p>
<p>Inclusive fitness has allowed evolution to produce social organisms, like humans, in which a range of interactions are critical for reproductive success.  Evolutionary mechanisms can produce <strong>eusocial</strong> organisms, where individuals act as a part of super-organism; bee hives and naked mole rat colonies behave in this way.  In eusocial organisms, only a limited subset of organisms reproduce to form the next generation, like the germ line of a multicellular organism [<a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ccab/Alexander1974.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>][<a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-eusociality-15788128" target="_blank">link</a>]. </p>

<p class="c3">In an ecosystem, organisms have to deal with the impacts of other organisms on their physical environment. </p>
<p class="c3">The most dramatic life-based environmental impact to date has been the generation of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as a waste product of one form of photosynthesis. <span class="c1">O<sub>2</sub> is highly reactive.
