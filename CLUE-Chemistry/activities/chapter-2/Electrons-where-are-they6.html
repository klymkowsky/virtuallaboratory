      <span class="arial">The general trend is that the ionization energy increases as you go from left to right across a horizontal row of the periodic table. However there are several anomalies – which are easier to see if you plot the data.&nbsp; We will come back to this fine structure later – but for now lets concentrate on the general trend.</span>      <strong><br />

    <td><p class="arial">SInce the ionization energy is increasing from Na to Ar the implication is the size of the atom (really the size of the electron cloud) is decreasing.&nbsp; This trend is repeated for all horizontal rows of the periodic table. To explain this odd phenomenon (and rest assured it is very counter intuitive) we have to include in our explanations both Coulomb’s Law, and the fact that the electrons are in different regions of the atom (orbitals). </p>

          <td width="34%"><span class="arial">Recall that as the principal quantum number increases, the types of orbitals that are associated with it increase. For n=1 only one type of orbital is allowed – the 1s. Atoms that have electrons only in the 1s orbital are H (1s1) and He (1s2). For n=2 (the second “shell) there are two types of orbitals allowed: s and p. </span></td>

<p class="arial">There are (potentially) one s orbital and three p orbitals, each of which can contain up to two electrons with opposite spins. Any one electron in any of the orbitals of the second shell will be both attracted to the nucleus and repelled by the other electrons in the shell. However, each electron is located in a slightly different area of the atom (for example the p orbitals are mutually perpendicular) and therefore do not repel each other as strongly as they would if they were in the same area. Thus as we go across the row from one element to the next, there is an extra proton in the nucleus, and an extra electron. Since the electron is not as strongly repelled by the others in that shell, the effect of this is that the positive charge in the nucleus appears to be somewhat larger than the corresponding charge on the electron cloud. The result is that for any quantum shell the size of the atom decreases from left to right across the periodic table. We say that the effective nuclear charge (that is the charge that attracts each electron)      </p>
