For example:            a wooden log or a tank of gasoline can sit, unchanging for years,            then with only a little &ldquo;provocation&rdquo; burst into flames            (or explodes). At the same time, other reactions occur in a more            stately fashion - an iron nail slowly rusts, or dead bodies decompose            (even in the absence of parasites, microbes, or detritivores). Some            reactions can, with time, go to completion - there is no wood left            in a completely burnt log, no metal left once the rusting is complete.            NaCl and HCl ionize completely and rapidly when reacted with water,            but - as we have seen acetic acid does not. Some reactions give off            energy (for example combustion reactions), while others absorb energy            from their surroundings (for example the dissolution of many salts            in water). Some reactions seem completely and totally irreversible            - once a log starts burning, it does not stop and reappear, reassembled            from CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (and energy). <br />        </p></td>    <td width="12">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="200"><p class="black1"><img src="graphics/chapter-8.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="clue contents" /><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr>        <td><p class="black">But, perhaps surprisingly, at the molecular level all reactions are reversible, at least in theory. In fact: we can reassemble the log (in a way) by allowing a tree to grow, using CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, H<sub>2</sub>O from the ground, and energy from the sun (photosynthesis), but the reverse reaction is far more complex and involved than the simple &ldquo;forward reaction&rdquo; - that is, burning. So what determines whether a reaction will happen or how far it will go, or even if it will go in the forward and reverse directions? Are these mysteries of the universe, or can they be understood in a coherent manner? </p>        <p class="black">Well, it turns out that once again, the universe behaves            in an orderly way, and by paying attention to various experimental            observations chemists have, over the last few centuries, come to            understand the factors that control the rate and extent of reactions.            Our studies of these ideas are going to lead us back to thermodynamics            and free energy, as well as the details of the molecular reorganizations            that occur during the forward and reverse reactions. In this chapter,            we introduce concepts that will allow us to predict how far a reaction            goes, and we will also consider how fast a reaction occurs. In both            cases, the keys to our approach understanding the behavior of chemical            reactions is to remember i) that they are really systems in which            reactants and products interact with their environment and ii) that            at the molecular level all reactions are reversible &ndash; what            controls rates and final states are the probabilities that reactions            occur. These probabilities change in a predictable manner as a function            of concentrations and temperature (and other reaction conditions).            Except for reactions driven by the absorption of light (and you could            view those as collisions of a sort), all reactions involve collisions            between molecules. That means that the concentrations of molecules            and the temperature of the system will be important. The concentrations            will determine how often various types of collisions take place (the            more molecules per unit volume, the more frequently collisions will            occur), while the temperature will determine the energetics of the            collisions (although - recall that there is a distribution of kinetic            energies of molecules at a particular temperature, so as we will            see, not all collisions will lead to a reaction). As a reaction proceeds,            and reactants are converted into products, so the probability of            reactant molecules colliding decreases and the probability of reactant            molecules colliding (productively) increases. This will continue            until the rate of the forward reaction and the rate of the backward            reactions are equal, and the system will reach &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo;,            a point at which no more macroscopic changes occur and at which the            concentrations of reactants and products will, at the macroscopic            scale, remain constant. As we will see the concentrations of reactants            and products at equilibrium will also depend on the temperature.            Molecular structure will also matter, since not all collisions will            be productive - only those in which molecules hit each other in particular            orientations (and with particular energies) will work. </p>        <p class="black">As an example, Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acid-base reactions are very fast; that is the probability that the reaction occurs per unit time is high. When an acid and a base are mixed together they react immediately, there is no waiting, no warming needed. The time it takes for the pH of an acid solution to change (upon the addition of the acid to water), is limited by the rate of mixing &ndash; at the molecular level, it occurs within an extremely short time. For example if we dissolve enough hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) in water to make an 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid, the pH immediately drops from 7 (the pH of water) to 1163. This measurement tells us that all the HCl has ionized, to give [H+] = 0.1 and [Cl&ndash;] = 0.1.</p>        <p class="black">Now let us take the case of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH).            If we dissolve enough acetic acid in water to make a 0.1 M solution,            the pH of the solution immediately changes from pH 7 (pure water)            to 2.9 (not 1). Even if you wait (as long as you want) the pH will            not change any further, it stays constant, around 3. You might well            ask &ldquo;what is going on here?&rdquo;  The acid-base reaction            of acetic acid and water is fast, but the pH is not as low as you            might have predicted. We can calculate the [H+] from the pH, again            using the relationship pH = &ndash; log [H+] and  [H+] = 10-pH  giving            us a value of [H+] = 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> M. That is the concentration            of H+ is more than two orders of magnitude less than you might have            expected! If you think about this, it must mean that the amount of            acetic acid (AcOH) that actually reacted with the water must have            been very small indeed. In fact we can calculate how much reacted            using the relationships from the equation: <br />        AcOH  + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; H<sub>3</sub>O+ + AcO&ndash;. <br />        <br />            If the concentration of acetic acid started at 0.10M, and after the                ionization reaction 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> M of H+ are                present, then the final concentration of acetic acid must be                (0.10 minus 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> M, which means (using                the appropriate number of significant figures) that the concentration                of acetic acid is still 0.10 M (actually 0.0986M). </p><p class="black"> There are two important issues here: first the reaction of    acetic acid is fast, and second - apparently most of the acetic acid has    not, in fact reacted with the water. But wait - there is more! Even if the    reaction appears to have stopped, since the pH does not change any further;    at the molecular level things are still happening. </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="527"><span class="black">That is, the reaction    of acetic acid with water, continues on, but the reverse reaction occurs    at the same rate, meaning that the bulk concentrations of all the species    remain constant, even though individual molecules present in each population    are constantly changing.As we will see the ideas about how far a reaction    proceeds (towards products) and how fast it gets there are intertwined.
