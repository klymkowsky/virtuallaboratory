However, there is an even broader model                of acid-base chemistry that can be used to incorporate reactions                even when there is no proton transfer. Instead of seeing the                reaction as a proton transfer, we can look at it from the vantage                point of the electron pair that eventually becomes part of the                new bond. That is: we can consider an acid-base reaction as the                donation of an electron pair (from a base) to form a bond between                the donor atom and the proton (or the acid). So instead of saying                water transfers a proton to ammonia, we can view this process                as ammonia donating a lone electron pair to form a new bond with        a proton from a water molecule. </span></p></td>    <td width="14">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="215"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter7txt.html" target="_self">7.1 Reactions </a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-2.html" target="_self">7.2 Types (Acid-Base)</a><br />        <strong>7.3 Lewis Acid-Base</strong><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-4.html" target="_self">7.4       Nucleo- &amp; Electrophiles</a><br />      <a href="chapter7txt-5.html" target="_self">7.5 Oxidation-Reduction</a><br />      <a href="chapter7txt-6.html" target="_self">7.6 Energetics</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black">This process results in the transfer of a hydrogen from          the water to the ammonia molecule (a bond formation event). The electrons          that were originally bonded to the H do not disappear - they are left          behind- leading to the generation of a hydroxide (&ndash;OH)  ion. This kind of analysis allows us to extend our considerations to reactions in which there is no &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; H, but where there is a lone pair of electrons that can form a new bond.  This approach is known as the Lewis acid-base model. <br />        <br />        An example of Lewis acid-base reaction is that between boron trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). In this case, the base is the electron pair donor and the acid is the electron pair acceptor.  The lone electron pair from NH<sub>3</sub> is donated to boron, which has an empty bonding o3bital and so can accept the pair of electrons, forming a bond between the N and the B. Even though we use the term &ldquo;donate&rdquo; the electron pair does not leave the NH<sub>2</sub> molecule, it changes from a non-bonding pair to a bonding pair of electrons. <br />        <br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td width="460"><span class="black">BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid, but note it has no H to donate, it represents a new class of acids.
