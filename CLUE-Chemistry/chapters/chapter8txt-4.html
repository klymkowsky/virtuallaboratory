This means            that the rate of the reaction can increase since, at a given temperature,            the rate at which collisions with enough energy to overcome the new            lower activation energy barrier occur more frequently. </p>        <p class="black">But because the catalyst is neither a reactant or a            product of the reaction, it does not influence the reactions&rsquo;s            overall energy change.

It is not uncommon for the rate of a catalyzed reaction            to be millions of times faster than the uncatalyzed reaction. That            said, there are many examples where enzymes catalyze &ldquo;off-target&rdquo; reactions            of the same or different types (although these reactions are generally            accelerated to a much lesser extent). This ability to catalyze a            range of reactions occurs because the surfaces of enzyme molecules            are complex and can often accommodate (and bind) a range of molecules,            they can be promiscuous. The common conception of an enzyme as            a lock and the reaction it catalyzes as its only key is far too simplistic,            in reality there are many molecules that can bind to a specific active            site in an enzyme. While the mode of action of enzymes varies, in            many cases the active site holds the two reactive molecules in close            juxtaposition which can speed their reaction (can you imagine why?)</p>        <p>An organic chemical reaction that requires a catalyst is the addition            of hydrogen across a C=C bond. Without the catalyst this reaction            would not occur on a human timescale, but it is an important reaction            in many pharmaceutical syntheses, and in the production of fat (solid)            from oil (liquids).<br />            <br />            <br />        </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td class="black"> For example: margarine is produced by adding hydrogen        to the C=C bonds of oils extracted from plants. The removal of the C=C        bond makes the molecules pack better together (since London dispersion        forces can now act upon the whole length of the molecule, this increases        the strength of the van der Waals interactions between the molecules)        and therefore the hydrogenated oil is a solid at room temperature. The        catalyst is usually a ?transition metal, palladium (Pd) or platinum (Pt),        finely divided and adsorbed onto the surface of an inert substance like        charcoal (carbon). The transition metal has empty d orbitals that can        interact with the C=C bond&rsquo;s pi orbital &ndash; destabilizing the        pi bond and making it more susceptible to reaction. x</td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch8-6.jpg" width="176" height="231" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="546"><p class="black">Unfortunately, in many cases the hydrogen                does not add across the double bond; instead the bond isomerizes                from cis to trans, thus forming the unnatural trans isomer, which                has been implicated in the development of heart disease.Unfortunately, in many cases the hydrogen                does not add across the double bond; instead the bond isomerizes                from cis to trans, thus forming the unnatural trans isomer, which                has been implicated in the development of heart disease. <br />            </p></td>        <td width="14">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="180"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter8txt.html" target="_self">8.1                    How for, how fast?</a><br />            <a href="chapter8txt-2.html" target="_self">8.2 Reaction rate</a><br />            <a href="chapter8txt-3.html" target="_self">8.3 Activation energy</a><br />            <strong>8.4 Catalysis</strong><br />            <a href="chapter8txt-5.html" target="_self">8.5 Equilibrium</a><br />            <a href="chapter8txt-6.html" target="_self">8.6 Mechanisms</a><br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul><li><span class="black">Draw a representation of an enzyme active site.
