This means that you can add reactants            or products, and as we will discuss in detail in later sections,            the constant does not change - it is a constant (that said, you            cannot change the temperature, that will change K<sub>eq</sub>. The implications            of this are quite profound. For example, if you add or take away            products or reactants from a reaction, it will shift so that it will            reach equilibrium again - with the same value of K<sub>eq</sub>, and since we            know (or can look up, or calculate) what the equilibrium constant            is, we will be able to figure out exactly what the system will do            to re-assert the equilibrium condition.</p>      <p class="black">We can generalize this relationship for a general reaction,      nA + mB &harr; oC + pD <br />          <br />    Note that each concentration is raised to the power of its coefficient in    the balanced reaction. By convention the constant is always written with    the products on the numerator, and the reactants in the denominator, meaning    that large values of K<sub>eq</sub> indicate that at equilibrium, the reaction mixture    has more products than reactants. Conversely a small value of K<sub>eq</sub> (typically &lt;1    - depending on the form of K<sub>eq</sub>) indicates that there are less products than    reactants in the mixture at equilibrium. The expression for Keq depends on    which way round you write the reaction - and you can prove to yourself that    K<sub>eq</sub>(forward) = 1/K<sub>eq</sub>(reverse). Other things to note are that if a pure liquid    or solid participates in the reaction, it is omitted from the equilibrium    expression for K<sub>eq</sub>.

It was certainly discovered empirically, and has been shown to be applicable to huge numbers of reactant systems, yet somehow it does not seem very satisfying to say &ldquo;this is the way things are&rdquo; without an explanation for why the equilibrium constant is constant. How does it relate to molecular structure? More simply what determines the equilibrium constant? What is the driving force that moves a reaction towards equilibrium, and then inhibits any further progress towards products?<br />          <br />        You will remember (we hope) that it is the Second Law of Thermodynamics        that tells us about the probability that a process will occur. The criterion        for a reaction to &ldquo;go&rdquo; is that the total entropy of the universe        must increase. We also learned that we can substitute the Gibb&rsquo;s        Free energy change (&Delta;G) for the entropy change of the universe,        which is much easier to relate to (and calculate) since it only pertains        to the system. So it should not be surprising that we can relate the        position of equilibrium in a reaction system to the free energy for that        reaction. We have already seen that a large negative free energy change        (from reactants to products) indicates that a process will occur (or        will be spontaneous - in thermodynamic terms) and a large positive        equilibrium constant means that the reaction mixture will contain mostly        products at equilibrium. It is not surprising then to find that the drive        towards equilibrium and the free energy change are related.</p>    <p class="black"> One way to think about this is that the position of equilibrium is where the maximum entropy change of the universe is found - that is, on either side of this position the entropy change is negative and therefore unlikely. If we plot the extent of the reaction versus the dispersion of energy (in the universe) or the free energy, we can see better what is meant by this. At equilibrium the system sits in at the bottom of an energy well. Any shift in the position of the reaction, forwards or backwards, will result in a decrease in entropy, or an increase in free energy. Remember, that even though at the macroscopic level the system seems to be at rest, at the molecular level the reactions is still occurring. At equilibrium the difference in free energy, &Delta;G, between the reactants and products is zero. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><span class="black">It bears repeating - the criterion for chemical equilibrium            is that &Delta;G = 0 for the reactants products.

Since any system will naturally tend to            this equilibrium condition, a system away from equilibrium can be            harnessed to do work, that is to drive some other non-favorable reaction            or system away from equilibrium, while a system at equilibrium cannot            do work - as we will see in greater detail shortly.</span></td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch8-8.jpg" width="122" height="150" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"> <p>The relationship between the standard free energy change            and the equilibrium constant is given by the equation  &Delta;G&ordm; =  &ndash; RT ln K, (which can be converted into the equation  ln K<sub>eq</sub> = &ndash; &Delta;G&ordm;/RT o rK<sub>eq</sub> = e &ndash;&Delta;G&ordm;/RT).  As we saw earlier the superscript &ordm; refers to thermodynamic quantities that are measured and calculated at standard states. In this case &Delta;G&ordm; refers to 1&nbsp;atmosphere pressure and 298K, and critical for our present discussion, 1 M concentrations for both reactants and products. That is: &Delta;G&ordm; tells you about the free energy change if all the substances in the reacting system were mixed with initial concentrations of 1.0 M. It allows us to calculate equilibrium constants from tables of free energy values (see chapter 9.) This is a rather artificial situation and you might be tempted to think that &Delta;G&ordm; is not very useful in the real world where initial concentrations of both reactants and products are rarely 1.0 M. But no, &Delta;G&ordm; does tell us something useful, namely which way a reaction will proceed under these starting conditions. Under a specific set of condition we can use &Delta;G&ordm; to calculate the actual free energy change &Delta;G; where &Delta;G = &Delta;G&ordm; +RT ln Q. In this equation Q (the reaction quotient) is of the same form as Keq (that is [products]/[reactants], except that the concentrations are not = 1M, but rather are the actual concentrations at the starting point. The sign and magnitude of &Delta;G            then will tell us which way the reaction will proceed and how far            in that direction it will go. <br />        The differences between Q and K<sub>eq</sub> and &Delta;G and &Delta;G&ordm;, are important to keep in mind. It is easy to get mixed up and apply them wrongly. Q and &Delta;G relate to non-equilibrium systems, andK<sub>eq</sub> and &Delta;G&ordm; tell us about the equilibrium state itself. At equilibrium, Q = Keq, and &Delta;G        = 0, so that: the equation <br />    &Delta;G = &Delta;G&ordm; +RT ln Q becomes, &Delta;G&ordm; = &ndash; RT ln Keq. </p>    <p>Note that K<sub>eq</sub> and &Delta;G&ordm; are constant for a given reaction at a given temperature, but Q and &Delta;G are not - their values vary according to the reaction conditions. In fact, using Q and/or &Delta;G we can predict how a system will behave under the specific conditions we care about,as it moves towards the highest entropy state (or the lowest value of &Delta;G). </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul><li><span class="black">As a system moves towards equilibrium, what is the sign of &Delta;G? as it moves away from equilibrium what is the sign of &Delta;G?</span></li>          <li><span class="black">Explain in your own words the difference between &Delta;G&ordm; and &Delta;G.</span></li>          <li><span class="black">Imagine you have a reaction system A ?

If          that system begins to change once mixed up (that is the reaction occurs          spontaneously), we can define the equilibrium state by the fact that          there are no longer changes in the concentrations of reactants and          products. We might actually think (not unreasonably) that the system          is static, and assume (perhaps) that the molecules in the system are          stable and no longer changing. But a little reflection might lead us          to question this assumption. What has changed at the molecular level?          In the case of our acetic acid example, there are still molecules of          acetic acid, (AcOH) acetate (AcO-) and hydronium ion (H<sub>3</sub>O+)          colliding with solvent water molecules and each other. Some of these          reactions will have enough energy to be productive; molecules of acetate          will transfer protons to water molecules and the reverse reaction will          also occur. What has changed is that the rate of acetate (AcO-) and          hydronium ion (H<sub>3</sub>O+) formation will be equal and opposite to the rate          of acetic acid deprotonation (transfer of the proton to water). While          there will be no net change at the macroscopic level, at the molecular          level, things are happening. Bonds are breaking and forming - this          is the dynamic equilibrium we discussed earlier. <br />        Now let us think about what happens if we disturb this equilibrium. </p>      <p class="black">At          equilibrium the acetic acid-water system contains acetic acid (AcOH),          protons (H<sub>3</sub>O+), and acetate ion (AcO&ndash;). We know that          a 0.10 M solution of acetic acid has concentrations of [H<sub>3</sub>O+]          = [AcO&ndash;] = 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> M. So what happens if          we add enough acetate to make the acetate concentration 0.10 M? One          way is to think about the new situation is to consider the probability          of the forward and the back reactions. Since we added more product          (acetate) the rate of the back reaction must increase (since there          are more acetate ions around to collide with.) In this new state &Delta;G will be negative.          But just as we saw previously, as soon as more acetic acid is formed,          the probability of the forward reaction increases and a new equilibrium          position will be established, where the rate of the forward reactions          will equal the rate of the back reaction.<br />          <br />          This probability argument gives us an idea of which way the equilibrium          will shift when disturbed, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us exactly where it will re-stabilize. For that we have to look at Q and Keq.  If we take the new initial reaction conditions (0.10 M AcOH, 0.10 M AcO&ndash;, and 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> M H<sub>3</sub>O+) and analyze them to determine the concentrations of all participating species, we can calculate Q, and compare it to Keq.<br />          Q = [H<sub>3</sub>O+][AcO&ndash;]/[AcOH]  = (1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>)(0.1)/(0.1)</p>      <p class="black">This generates a value for Q as 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>.          Now if we compare Q and Keq we see that Q is larger than Keq (1.3 x          10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> &gt; 1.8 x 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup>). To re-establish          equilibrium the system will have to shift so that Q becomes smaller,          that is equal to Keq (at which point &Delta;G = 0.)  To do this the          numerator [products] must decrease, while the denominator [reactants]          increases. That is: the reaction must go backwards, to re-establish          an equilibrium state. Just as we argued earlier from probability considerations.<br />          <br />        If we re-calculate the [H<sub>3</sub>O+] under the new equilibrium conditions        (that is 0.10 M AcOH and 0.10 M acetate) we find that it has decreased        considerably, from its initial value of 1.3 x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup> to        the new value of 1.8 x 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup> M. Using this to calculate        the pH we discover that addition of sodium acetate causes the pH to rise        from 2.9 to 4.5 - which may not seem like much, but remember that each        pH unit is a factor of 10 so this rise in pH actually indicates a drop        in hydronium ion concentration of a bit less than 100 fold. In order        to regain the most stable situation the system shifted to the left, reducing        the amounts of product.<br />        AcOH  + H<sub>2</sub>O+ &harr; H<sub>3</sub>O+ + AcO&ndash;<br />        <br />          There are a number of exercises that will allow you to become conversant              with the calculations involved in defining the effects of perturbations              on the equilibrium state of a system (many chemistry books are              full of such &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; and pH problems. What is really              important, however, is that upon perturbation a system will return              to equilibrium. That is where the system is most stable. And once              the system is at equilibrium further perturbations (changes in              conditions, concentrations and temperature) will lead to a new            equilibrium state. </p>      <p class="black"><strong>Le Chatelier&rsquo;s Principle</strong><br />          <br />        You may recognize the preceding discussion as a rather well known idea articulated by Henry Louis Le Chatelier: &ldquo;If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature, volume, or partial pressure, then the equilibrium shifts to counteract the imposed change and a new equilibrium is established.&rdquo;  Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle is one of the best known and most widely applicable heuristics (that is a rule of thumb that helps you predict an outcome) in chemistry and science for that matter.  However, it is important to understand why this principle works. Le Chatelier&rsquo;s Principle is yet another reminder that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is never broken, it is always in force.<br />        <br />        Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle specifically mentions the kinds of changes that can affect the position of equilibrium, yet we have only discussed changes in concentrations. What about temperature volume, and partial pressure? How do they affect equilibrium? We have also not specifically addressed equilibrium reactions that take place in the gas phase (for example, many atmospheric reactions - including the formation and depletion of ozone, are important reactions). However, there is nothing really special or different about them. The equilibrium constant for gas phase reactions can be calculated either using partial pressures of each gas, or concentrations (mol/L), although the value of Keq differs depending on which units you choose, and you can&rsquo;t mix and match - that is, you need to use either all pressures or all concentrations. Therefore the effect of increasing the volume is the same as decreasing the concentration, and increasing the pressure has the same effect as increasing the concentration. (Note however that adding a gas that is not a participant in the reaction has no effect even though the total pressure will be increased). To understand the effects of temperature on the position of equilibrium we have to go back to our discussion of reaction rates.<br />  <br />        <strong>Temperature, Equilibrium and Reaction Rates.<br />        </strong><br />        The effect of changing the temperature on the position of equilibrium        is a little more complex. At first guess, you might predict that if you        increase the temperature, it will affect the rates of both the forward        and back reactions equally. However if we look more closely - this is        not true. Cast your mind back to the discussions of temperature and thermal        energy. If the temperature of the system is raised, it means that thermal        energy has been added to the system from the surroundings. We can treat        the addition of energy to the system as a stress, and according to Le        Chatelier&rsquo;s Principle, if something in the system is changed (concentration,        volume, pressure, temperature) then the system will shift to a new equilibrium        state. In order to predict what affect adding energy will have on the        system, we need to have more information about the energy changes associated        with that system. As we saw earlier, the enthalpy change (&Delta;H),        tells us about the thermal energy change for systems under constant pressure        (that is most of the systems we are interested in). We can measure or        calculate enthalpy changes for many reactions, and therefore can use        them to predict the effect of increasing the temperature (or adding thermal        energy). For example: let us take the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen        to form ammonia. This reaction is N<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>(g)        &harr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub> (g) (&Delta;H = -92.4 kJ/mol).  The reaction        is exothermic - for each mole of ammonia (17g) 92.4 kJ of thermal energy        is produced and transferred to the surroundings (as indicated by the        negative sign of the enthalpy change.) Now if we heat this reaction up,        what will happen to the position of equilibrium?<br />        <br />Let us rewrite the equation to show that thermal energy is produced:<br />    N<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (g) &harr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub> (g) + 184.8    kJ (2 x 92.4 kJ since two moles of ammonia are produced.) If thermal energy    is a &ldquo;product&rdquo; of    the reaction, then applying Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle if we add more    product the reaction should shift towards the reactants. Sure enough, if    we heat this reaction up, the position of equilibrium shifts towards ammonia    and hydrogen - it starts to go backwards! This is actually quite a problem,    since this reaction requires a fairly high temperature to make it &ldquo;go&rdquo; in    the first place. It makes the production of ammonia difficult if, when you    heat up the reaction, it goes in the opposite direction to the one you want. </p>      <p class="black">It is important to remember that Le Chatelier&rsquo;s          principle is only a heuristic, it doesn&rsquo;t tell us why the system        shifts to the left. To answer this question let us consider the energy        profile for an exothermic reaction. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><br />         We can see that the activation energy (E&rsquo;a)        for the reverse reaction is larger than that for the forward reaction        (Ea). Another way to say this is that more energy is required for molecules        to react for the reverse reaction to occur than for the forward reaction.        Therefore it makes sense that if you supply more energy the reverse reaction        will be affected more than the forward reaction.</td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch8-9.jpg" width="191" height="130" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black"><strong><br />      Equilibrium and Steady State</strong></p>      <p class="black">Now here is an interesting point, imagine a situation in which reactants and products are continually being added to and removed from a system. Such systems are described as &ldquo;open&rdquo;, meaning that matter (and energy) are entering or leaving them; open systems are never at equilibrium. Assuming that the changes to the system occur on a time scale that is faster than the rate the system returns to equilibrium following such a perturbation, the system could well be stable and such stable, non-equilibrium systems are referred as &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; systems (living organisms are steady state systems).  An analogy might be a cup with a hole in it being filled from a tap, if the rate at which water flows into the cup is equal to the rate at which it flows out, the level of water in the cup would stay the same, but the water in it would constantly be added to and leaving the system (the cup). Biological systems are open systems, with energy and matter entering and leaving, while most equilibrium systems studied in chemistry (at least those discussed in introductory texts) are closed. </p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>          <td width="86%"><span class="black"><br />In addition, biological systems are characterized by the fact that there        are multiple reactions occurring simultaneously, and that a number of        these reactions share components.That is, the products of one reaction       are the reactants in other reactions. This end result is a system of &ldquo;coupled        reactions.&rdquo;  Such systems can produce quite complex behaviors (chapter        9). An interesting coupled reaction system (aside from life itself) is       the Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, </span></td>          <td width="14%"><img src="graphics/ch8-10.jpg" width="140" height="142" /></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="black">in which cesium catalyzes        the oxidation and bromination of malonic acid (CH<sub>2</sub>(COOH)<sub>2</sub>)        by BrO<sub>3</sub>&ndash; in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  If the system        is not being actively stirred, this reaction can produces quite complex        and dynamic spatial patterns. While the typical BZ reaction involves        a closed system, it will eventually reach a boring (macroscopically static)        equilibrium state. The open nature of biological systems means that complex        behaviors do not have to stop, they continue over very long periods of        time. Together the Cell Theory of Life (that is, that all cells are derived        from preexisting cells and that all organisms are built from cells or        their products) and the fossil record indicate that the non-equilibrium        system of coupled chemical reactions we call life has persisted, uninterrupted,        for at least ~3.5 billion years (now that is a hard to accept idea, for        something as fragile as life). <br />        <br />      </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="523"><span class="black">The steady state systems found in                organisms display two extremely important properties, they are                adaptive and homeostatic. That means that they can change in                response to various stimuli (adaptation) and they tend to return                their original state following a perturbation (homeostasis).                Both are distinct from Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle in that                they are not passive, but active - that is energy requiring processes.                While adaptation and homeostasis may seem contradictory, in fact                they work together to keep living things alive and enable them                to adapt to changing conditions.
