If light(that is, electromagnetic radiation), which was classically considered as a wave,could have the properties of a particle, then perhaps matter, classically consideredas composed of particles, might have the properties of waves, at least underconditions such as those that exist within an atom. This totally counterintuitiveidea was considered by Louis De Broglie (1892 &ndash; 1987) in his Ph.D. thesis.De Broglie used Planck&rsquo;s relationship between energy and frequency (E =h&nu;), the relationship between frequency and wavelength (c = &lambda;&nu;),and Einstein&rsquo;s relationship between energy and mass (E = mc<sup>2</sup>) to derivea relationship between the mass and wavelength for any particle (including photons).You can do this yourself by substituting into these equations &ndash; and youwill come up with &lambda; = h/mv, where mv is the momentum of a particle withmass m and velocity v. In the case of photons, v = c, the velocity of light. </p></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="200"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter2txt.html" target="_self">2.1 Electrons &amp; Orbitals</a><br />        <a href="chapter2txt-2.html" target="_self">2.2 Quanta</a><br />        <a href="chapter2txt-3.html" target="_self">2.3 Spectroscopy</a><br />        <strong>2.4       Beyond Bohr</strong><br />      <a href="chapter2txt-5.html">2.5 Periodic table</a><br />      <a href="chapter2txt-6.html" target="_self">2.6 Orbitals plus</a><br />      <a href="chapter2txt-7.html" target="_self">2.7 Quantum numbers</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black">If the math involved in deriving the relationship between        a particle&rsquo;s momentum (mv) and its wavelength &lambda; is simple,        the ideas behind it most certainly are not.

The answer is not completely obvious. You might think it would be easier to determine where a particle is, but things get complicated as we get smaller and smaller. Imagine that we wanted to view an electron within an atom using some type of microscope (in this case, an imaginary one with unlimited resolution). To see something, we have to bounce (or reflect) a photon off it (hopefully this makes sense to you) and these photons must enter our eye, be absorbed by a molecule in our retinal cells, and start a signal to our brain (where the signal is processed and interpreted.) When we look at macroscopic objects, their interactions with light have little effect on them - objects in a dark room do not begin to move just because you turn the lights on! Obviously, the same cannot be said for atomic scale objects, we already know that a photon of light can knock an electron completely out of an atom (the photoelectric effect). Now we come to another factor, the shorter the wavelength of light we use, the more accurately we can locate an object. Remember, however, that wavelength and energy are related, the shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy. To look at, and locate, something as small as an atom or an electron we have to use electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength similar to the size of the electron. We already know that an atom is about 10<sup>-10</sup> m in diameter, so electrons are presumably much smaller. Let us say we use gamma rays (&lambda;= ~10<sup>-12</sup> m).  But radiation of such short wavelength carries lots of energy, these are high-energy photons. When such a high energy photon interacts with the electron it dramatically perturbs the electron's position and motion. That is: if we try to measure where an electron is, we perturb it by the very act of measurement. The act of measurement introduces uncertainty, and this uncertainty increases the closer we get to the atomic molecular scale.</p>    <p>This idea was first explicitly put forward by Werner Heisenberg, and is known as the Heisenberg  Uncertainty Principle. According to the uncertainty principle, we can estimate the uncertainty in a measurement using the formula &Delta;mv times &Delta;x &gt; h/4&pi;, where &Delta;mv is the uncertainty in the momentum of the particle (mass times velocity or where it is going and how fast) and &Delta;x is the uncertainty in its position in space (where it is at a particular moment). If we know exactly where the particle is (that is &Delta;x = 0) then we have absolutely no information about its velocity, we do not know how fast or in what direction it is going. Alternatively, if we know its momentum exactly, that is &Delta;mv = 0 (that is exactly how fast and in which direction it is going), we have no idea whatsoever where it is!  The end result is that we cannot know, even in theory, exactly where an electron is without losing information on its momentum. This has lots of strange implications. If the electron were known to be within the nucleus (&Delta;x ~1.5 x 10<sup>-14</sup> m) we will have very little idea of its momentum (how fast and where it was going).  This turns out to be a key feature of atomic level systems &ndash; there are inherent uncertainties in the properties of these systems. For example we can estimate some properties very accurately, but we cannot know everything about an atomic-molecular-level system at one time. This is a very different perspective from the one it replaced, which was famously summed up by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) who stated that if the positions and velocities of every object in the universe were known, the future would be set. <br />      <br />      <em>&quot;We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes&quot;.
