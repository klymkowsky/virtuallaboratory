So, which end of the molecule &ldquo;wins&rdquo;? Do such molecules dissolve in water or not? The answer is: both!  Such amphipathic molecules become arranged in such a manner that their polar groups are in contact with the water, and their non-polar regions are not (you might even try and see if you can draw out such an arrangement, remembering to include the water molecules in your drawing. </span></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p>There are, in fact, several ways to produce such an            arrangement, depending in part on the amount of water in the system.            A standard micelle, which is a spherical structure with the polar            heads on the outside and the non-polar tails on the inside, is the            simplest structure that can accommodate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic            groups in the same molecule. </p>    <p>If water is limiting, it is possible to get an &ldquo;inverted micelle&rdquo; arrangement, in which polar head groups (and water) are inside, and the non-polar tails point outward.

It should be noted that these ordered structures are possible only because dispersing the lipid molecules in water would result in an substantial decrease in the disorder of the system. In fact, many ordered structures associated with living systems ,such as the structure of DNA and proteins, are the result of &ldquo;entropy-driven&rdquo; processes (yet another counter-intuitive idea) &ndash; this is one (of many) reasons that biological systems do not violate the laws of thermodynamics and why it is scientifically plausible that life arose due to natural processes!</p></td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch6-7.jpg" width="146" height="412" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black"><strong>Solutions, Colloids &amp; Emulsions</strong></p>      <p class="black"> So, are micelles dissolved in water? Well, micelles are not molecules, but rather supramolecular assemblies - composed of many distinct molecules. While a glucose solution consists of isolated glucose molecules, micelles in solution are different, at least terms of the size of the solute. Because of these differences, we give such &ldquo;solutions of macromolecular solutes&rdquo; a distinct name, they are known as colloids. These particles can be aggregates of molecules (like micelles), atoms (nanoparticles), or larger &ldquo;macromolecules&rdquo; (proteins, nucleic acids), among others. When these particles are on the order of the wavelength of visible light, they scatter the light; smaller objects do not. That is why a salt or sugar solution is translucent, while a colloidal dispersion of micelles or cells (for example) is cloudy.   This is the reason that soap solutions are typically cloudy - they contain  particles large enough to scatter the light. When the particles in a solution can be considered &ldquo;solid&rdquo;, the end result is known as a colloid. Because of their small size and thermal movements such small solid particles can remain suspended -  the colloid is stable.  As the particles get larger, the colloid will become unstable; the influence of gravity will overcome the effects of thermal motion, and the particles will settle out. Before they settle out, such unstable systems are known as suspensions. <br />          <br />      </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="539"><p class="black">On the other hand when the suspended                particles can themselves be considered liquid, the system is                known as an emulsion. There are conditions in which oil and water                can be mixed, for example in salad dressing. If we were to look                carefully (with a microscope), we would see drops of oil suspended                in water. Emulsions are often unstable, and with time the two                liquid &ldquo;phases&rdquo; can separate - this is one reason                that you have to shake up salad dressing. We see situations of                both colloids and emulsions in the world around us. Milk, for                example, is an emulsion of fat globules and a colloid of protein                (casein) micelles. <br />        </p></td>        <td width="11">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="190"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter6txt.html" target="_self">6.1                    Solutions </a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-2.html" target="_self">6.2 Solubility </a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-3.html">6.3 H-bonds</a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-4.html">6.4 Free Energy</a><br />            <strong>6.5 Polarity</strong><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-6.html" target="_self">6.6 Temperature</a><br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">If you had a compound that your suspected might form micelles:</li>        <li class="black">What structural features would you look for?</li>        <li class="black">How might you design an experiment to determine whether the compound would form micelles in water?</li>        <li class="black">What would be the experimental evidence?</li>        <li class="black">Why do you think some amphipathic molecules form spherical clusters (micelles or liposomes) while others form sheets - bilayers?
