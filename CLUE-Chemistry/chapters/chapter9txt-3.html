In                this buffer system the carbonic acid can react with any base                that enters the bloodstream, and the bicarbonate with any acid.                This buffering system is more complex than the isolated ones                we considered earlier, since one of the components (carbonic                acid) is also part of another equilibrium reaction. In essence,                this means that the pH of the blood is dependent of the amount                of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.<br />            H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> &harr; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O            &harr; HCO<sub>3</sub>&ndash; + H<sub>3</sub>O+<br />            <br />                If we remove water from the equations (for the sake of clarity)                we can (hopefully) see the connection better.<br />                CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> &harr; HCO<sub>3</sub>&ndash; + H<sub>3</sub>O+<br />                <br />                The pK<sub>a</sub> of carbonic acid is 6.37, and the pH of blood is typically          7.2-7.4, which does fall (just) within the buffering range. </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td width="73%"><span class="black">Under                normal circumstances this buffer system can handle most changes                but for larger changes, other systems are called into play to          help regulate the pH.

As the concentration                of CO<sub>2</sub> increases,                a process known as chemoreception activates nervous systems that                in turn regulate (increase) heart and respiratory rates, which                in turn leads to an increase in the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> and                oxygen exchange in the lungs - as you breathe in O<sub>2</sub> you                breathe out CO<sub>2</sub> (removing                it from your blood). In essence - Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle                explains why we pant when we exercise! Conversely, when some                people get excited they breathe too fast (hyperventilate); too                much CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the blood, which reduces                the H<sub>3</sub>O+ concentration and increases the pH. This                can lead to fainting (which slows down the breathing), a rather                drastic way to return your blood to its correct pH. An alternative,                non-fainting approach is to breathe into a closed container.                Since you are now breathing expelled CO<sub>2</sub> (and a lower                level of O<sub>2</sub>),                this also leads to an increase in blood pH.<br />                <br />                While we invoke Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle to explain the                effect of rapid or slow breathing, this response is one based                on what are known as adaptive and homeostatic systems. Biological                systems are characterized by many such, often interconnected,                regulatory mechanisms, that have evolved to maintain a stable                chemical internal environment essential for life. Similar coupled                regulatory systems lie at the heart of immune and nervous system                function. Understanding the behavior of these coupled systems                is at the forefront of many research areas. At their base, they                rely on chemical systems to measure the levels of various chemicals                (a process known as chemoreception), recognize and respond to                foreign molecules (in the case of the immune system), and respond                to stimuli from both the outside world (light, sound, smell,                touch) and internal factors (in the case of the nervous system).                Downstream of these &rdquo;sensory&rdquo; systems, are networks                of genes, proteins and other molecules whose interactions are                determined by the thermodynamics of the chemical system. While                they were formed by evolutionary processes, and are often baroque                in their details, they are understandable in terms of the molecular                interactions, chemical reactions, and their accompanying energy      changes.</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><hr size="1" noshade />            <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>            <ul>                <li><span class="black">If the pK<sub>a</sub> of carbonic acid is 6.35 and the pH of blood is                    over 7, what do you think the relative amounts of carbonic                acid and bicarbonate are?

Now let us turn to another aspect of            coupled reactions, in which we can use the same principles to explain            why it is possible to make reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable &ldquo;go&rdquo;.            We will consider a fairly simple example and then move on to see            how this works in biological systems. <br>        <br />            Many metals are not found in their elemental form. For example copper,            is an important metal used for a wide range of applications (from            wires to roofs). It is often found as chalcocite, an ore containing            copper as copper sulfide. We could imagine a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; chemical            reaction, <br />            Cu<sub>2</sub>S(s) &harr; 2Cu(s) + S(s)   &Delta;G&ordm; = 86.2 kJ/mol <br />            <br />            that would allow us to separate the copper from the sulfide. Note            that this reaction is a redox reaction in which the Cu+ ion is reduced            to Cu by the addition of an electron (from the sulfide S<sub>2</sub>&ndash;  which            is oxidized to sulfur with an oxidation state of 0). Unfortunately,            since the free energy change for this reaction is positive, at equilibrium            the system will be composed mostly of Cu<sub>2</sub>S(s). How can we get copper            out of copper sulfide?<br />            <br />One possibility to exploit the reaction between            sulfur and oxygen: <br />            S(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) &harr; SO<sub>2</sub> (g), for which &Delta;G&ordm; = &ndash;300.1 kJ/mol <br />            <br />            This reaction is highly favorable and &ldquo;goes&rdquo; toward the            production of SO<sub>2</sub>. It is basically the burning of sulfur (analogous            to the burning of carbon) - and is another redox reaction in which          the sulfur is oxidized (from an oxidation state of 0 to +4).<br>          <br />          If we take Cu<sub>2</sub>S(s) together with O<sub>2</sub>(g), we have a system composed            of two reactions: <br />          <br />        Cu<sub>2</sub>S(s)  &harr;  2Cu(s) + S(s) [reaction 1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) &harr; SO<sub>2</sub> (g) [reaction 2]. <br />          <br />          Since these two reactions share a common component (S(s)), they are          coupled. Imagine what happens when the reaction 1 proceeds, even          a little. The S(s) produced can then react with the O<sub>2</sub>(g) present.            As this reaction proceeds toward completion, S(s) is removed, leaving            Cu (s) and SO<sub>2</sub> (g). Based on Le Chatelier's principle, reaction 1            is now out of equilibrium, and so will generate more S(s) (and Cu(s)).            Reaction 1 which would, in isolation, produce relatively little copper            or sulfur, is dragged toward the products by reaction 2, a favorable            reaction that removes sulfur from the system. If we assume that there            are no other reactions occurring within the system, we can calculate            the &Delta;G&ordm; for the coupled reactions 1 and 2. Under standard            conditions, we simply add the reactions together. </p><p class="black"><img src="graphics/ch9-table3.jpg" alt="" width="456" height="141" /></p>          <p class="black">So, the &Delta;G&ordm; for the coupled reaction                    is -213.9kJ/mol. This same basic logic applies to any coupled                    reaction system. Note that the common intermediate, by which                    these two reactions are linked is sulfur (S). However it                    is not always so simple to identify the common intermediate;                    and in this system, we are tacitly assuming that O<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> do not react with either Cu<sub>2</sub>S or SO<sub>2</sub>. If they did, these                    reactions would also need to be considered in our analysis                    - in fact, we will always need to consider all of the reactions                    that are possible with a system. While this is normally not                    a big issue with simple chemical systems that contain relatively                    small numbers of different types of molecules (sometimes                    called species), it is a significant concern when we consider                    biological or ecological systems, which contain many thousands                    of different types of molecules, which can interact and react          in a number of ways. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td width="74%"><p class="black">For example, you may have learned (in biology)                    that the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used to                    store and provide energy for cellular processes. What exactly                    does this mean? First, let us look at the structure of ATP,                    it is composed of a base, adenine, a sugar ribose, and three                    phosphate units.

We have already mentioned that ATP is unstable,                and the loss of one of the phosphate groups relieves some of                the strain caused by the charge repulsion between the three negatively                charged phosphate groups in ATP. The bond energies in the product                are stronger than the bond energies in the reactants and thus                the reaction is exothermic. (this is all somewhat complicated                - just like everything in living systems - by the presence of                other substances in the cellular fluids, such as metal ions,                Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> - and changes in pH - but the explanation is still                valid). Make sure that you do not fall prey to the commonly held                misconception that it is the breaking of the P-O bond that releases                energy - <strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong> - it is the formation of more stable                (stronger) bonds that releases energy.<br />                <br />                If we go one step further and look at the actual free energy                change &Delta;G (as opposed to the standard change), using typical                cellular concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi, and &Delta;G = &Delta;G&ordm; +                RTlnQ (where Q = [ADP][Pi]/[ATP]), we can calculate that &Delta;G                = &ndash; 52 kJ/mol (assuming that typically [ATP] is about ten                times [ADP], and that Pi is about 0.001M). That is - in real                conditions in the cell the free energy change is much higher                than the standard free energy change. This energy is not wasted                - but is used to drive other reactions that would not otherwise                occur. However, this energy cannot be used to drive any random                reaction, the reactions have to be coupled (just like the carbon                dioxide carbonate system) by common intermediates.<br />                A typical reaction scenario is the transfer of that terminal                phosphate group to another biomolecule. This transfer occurs                with lipids and proteins - but typically the reacting group is                an alcohol (ROH) or sometimes a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). The                reaction that takes place is almost the same as the hydrolysis                reaction - except that the incoming nucleophile has much more &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; attached                to the oxygen.<br />                <br />                The formation of these phosphate esters makes the original functional                group more reactive, so for example the formation of an amide                bond, which is the major bond that holds proteins together, is                normally exergonic (about + 2 to 4 kJ/mol). That is, the formation                of amide bonds is not spontaneous (you might want to think about                what this means for the amide bonds in the proteins that make                up a good portion of you). So protein synthesis is coupled with                ATP hydrolysis, as is the production of many biomolecules, sugars,                lipids, RNA and DNA. While the reactions are complex, each of                these are driven by series of individual reactions that are linked                by common intermediates. <br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><hr size="1" noshade />            <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>            <ul>                <li><span class="black">Can you draw the protonated form of ATP?</span></li>                <li><span class="black">Can you draw the unprotonated form of                        ATP showing how the negative charge is stabilized by                the surrounding cellular fluids?

The short answer involves two ideas                that we have encountered before. First, while ATP is unstable                (like wood in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>2), its hydrolysis does involve                overcoming an activation energy, and so under physiological conditions,                that means an enzyme (and ATPase). Second, ATP is formed through                coupled reactions that link the oxidation of molecules such as                glucose or the direct absorption of energy in the form of light                (photosynthesis). When glucose reacts with oxygen it forms carbon                dioxide and water. <br />            <br />          C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> &harr; 6CO<sub>2</sub> +          6H<sub>2</sub>O <br />            <br />                The overall standard free energy change &Delta;G&ordm; = &ndash;&nbsp;2870                kJ/mol. The reasons for this high negative free energy change                are that &Delta;S&ordm; is positive (why do you think this is?),                and there is a large negative &Delta;H&ordm; change. Remember                that &Delta;H&ordm; can                be approximated by looking at the changes in bond energy from                reactants to produces. A major reason for this high enthalpy                change is that the bond energies in carbon dioxide are very high                (a C=O bond takes 805 kJ/mol to break), and therefore when a                C=O bond is formed a large amount of energy is released. When                one mole of glucose is completely oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> and                H<sub>2</sub>O the energy produced is harnessed to ultimately produce ~36                moles of ATP (from ADP and Pi). </p>          <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">            <tr>              <td width="44%"><span class="black">While the mechanism(s) involved in this process are complex (involving            intervening ion gradients and rotating enzymes), the basic principle            remains.
