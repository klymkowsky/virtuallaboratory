In everyday usage buffer means a safeguard or a barrier            - something that provides a cushion or shield between you and something            harmful. But in chemistry (and biology) the meaning of buffer is            different and quite specific - a buffer is a solution that resists            changes in pH. As we will see this ability is critically important            to living systems. Many reactions                are affected by changes in pH. For example, strong acid and base                solutions are harmful to living tissue because they cause rapid                hydrolysis of the bonds that hold you together. <br />        </p></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="200"><p class="black1"><a href="http://highlighter.com/reader?hash=lnk-3774962" target="_blank">9.1 Reaction systems</a><br />      <strong>9.2 Buffered systems</strong><a href="http://highlighter.com/reader?hash=lnk-3774962" target="_blank"><br />      9.3 Activation energy</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>        <td><p class="black">That is, acidic                or basic solutions can speed up the reactions in which the bonds                are broken (dead bodies are often disposed of in murder mysteries                - and sometimes in real life - by dissolving them in strong acid                or base). </p>          <p class="black">Even relatively small fluctuations in pH can cause            devastating changes in the rates (and types) of reactions that            are continuously occurring in living systems - the major reason            being that proteins have many weak acidic and basic groups.

Let us                    start by considering what would happen if we took 0.10 moles                    of hydrogen chloride gas and dissolved it in enough water                    to make one liter of solution. The resulting 0.10 M solution                    of hydrochloric acid HCl (aq) would have a pH of 1 (pH = &ndash; log (0.10), = &ndash; log (1.0 x 10<sup>&ndash;1</sup>).                That is the pH of the solution would change from 7 (for pure                water) to 1, a change of 6 orders of magnitude in [H+]. Now if                we do the same experiment adding 0.10 mol HCl(g) to an appropriately                buffered solution, we would find the pH of the resulting solution                would not change much. </span></p>            <p class="black"> To understand how this happens we have to review                some acid-base chemistry, and look at what happens when acids                and base react, what the products are, and how those products                behave. As we just calculated the pH of a 0.10 M strong acid                is 1.0. It would not matter which strong acid we chose - as long                as it only had one proton to donate, so the pH of solutions HCl,                HBr, and HClO<sub>4</sub> would all be the same - because they                are all almost completely ionized in aqueous solution. However                if we take a weak acids, like acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH),                hydrogen fluoride (HF), phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)                or carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), the pH of each                will differ, and none of them will be as low as the strong acids,                because they do not ionize completely in solution. So for example,                the pH of 0.10 M acetic acid is ~ 2.9, since the concentration                of H+ is lower than in 0.10 M HCl. While that might not seem                much different from a pH of 1, remember the [H+] is 10<sup>&ndash;1</sup> or                0.1 M for a pH of 1 and 10-2.9 or 0.0012 M for a pH 2.9.</p>            <p class="black">Now if we look at the conjugate bases of weak and strong acids                we will see an analogous difference in their behavior to produce                solutions with different pHs. The conjugate base of HCl is Cl&ndash; (the                chloride ion). However since we can&rsquo;t just get a bottle                of chloride (we need a counter ion for charge balance), we will                use sodium chloride, NaCl, since we know that sodium ions are                not reactive (they are usually spectator ions). If we measure                the pH of a solution of NaCl, we will find that, just like water,                it is 7. Neither the sodium ion, nor the chloride ion affect                the pH. However if we take the corresponding conjugate base from                acetic acid, for example sodium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONa), we find that                a 0.1 M solution has a pH of about 9. Now this is quite surprising            at first glance. </p>            <p class="black">Sodium acetate belongs to the class of compounds                that we generically label as &ldquo;salts&rdquo;. In everyday                life we use salt to mean sodium chloride, but in chemistry the                term salt refers to compound that contains the conjugate base                of an acid, and a cation. While it might be tempting to think                of all salts being rather innocuous and unreactive (like sodium                chloride) it turns out that both components of the salt (the                conjugate base anion, and the cation) can affect the properties                of the salt - even in a simple reaction like dissolving in water.                In fact, the pH of any conjugate base of a weak acid tends to                be basic. <br />                <br />                Let us investigate a bit further. This observation implies that                the acetate ion (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&ndash;</sup>) must be reacting with water to                produce hydroxide (since we already know the Na+ does not react                with water). This reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction. The                name is derived from the Greek words for water (hydro) and to                break or separate (lysis) - it refers to reactions in which water                is one of the reactants.<br />                CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&ndash;</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) &harr; CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (aq)                + &ndash;OH(aq)<br />                <br />                The production of hydroxide increases [&ndash;OH], which in turn,                affects [H+] since the two are related by the equilibrium expression                [H+] [&ndash;OH] = 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;14</sup> = K<sub>w</sub>.<br />                <br />                That is: when the salt of a weak acid (that is its conjugate                base) is dissolved in water, a weak base is produced - and that                weak base has all the properties of any base - that is, it can                react with an acid - as we will see.<br />                <br />                It is possible to calculate the pH of solutions of weak bases,                just as it is to calculate pH of weak acids, if you know the                acid equilibrium constant. However, what is more interesting                is what happens when a solution contains significant amounts                of both a weak acid and its conjugate base. For example if we                take a solution that is 0.10 M in both acetic acid and sodium                acetate, we can calculate what the pH would be by setting up                the equilibrium table <br />                <br />               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AcOH + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; H<sub>3</sub>O+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + 	<sup>&ndash;</sup>OAc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Na+&nbsp; <br />              Initial              concentrations 0.10 M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.10 M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.10            M </p>            <p class="black">Note that even though acetate is present in                    the initial mixture we have put it on the product side because                    once both acetic acid and acetate are present in the same                    solution their concentrations are &ldquo;linked&rdquo; -                    they become part of an equilibrium system that can described                    by the equilibrium constant for acetic acid. If the concentration                    of one species is changed, the other must respond. For example:                    recall in Chapter 8 we looked at what happens to the pH of                    a solution of acetic acid when acetate ion is added. The                    presence of acetate affects the position of equilibrium for                    the acetic acid dissociation, and instead of a pH of 2.9                    (for 0.10M acetic acid) the concentration of solution that                    is 0.10 M in acetic acid and sodium acetate is 4.7. The presence                of the common ion acetate has suppressed the ionization of acetic                acid. We can calculate the pH of the resulting solution by adapting              the expression for the acid dissociation equilibrium: <br />                <br />                Ka = [H+][AcO<sup>&ndash;</sup>]/[AcOH]<br />                <br />                We are going to ignore any reaction with water from both the                acetic acid and the acetate ion because they will not affect                the pH significantly, since both are relatively &ldquo;weak&rdquo;.                Even if we take these reactions into account it will not change                the answer we get. Substituting in the equation for Ka we get <br />                <br />              Ka = 1.8 x 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup> = [H+] (0.10)/(0.10). <br />                <br />                Alternatively we can take negative logs of both sides giving                us: <br />                <br />                pKa = pH &ndash; log [AcO&ndash;]/[AcOH]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pH = pKa + log [AcO&ndash;]/[AcOH]<br />                <br />              This equation is known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation;              it is a convenient way to calculate the pH of solutions that              contain weak acids and their conjugate bases (or weak bases and    their conjugate acids).</p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><hr size="1" noshade />            <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>            <ul>                <li><span class="black">What would be the pH of a buffer system if the concentration                    of the acid component is equal to the concentration of its                conjugate base? </span></li>                <li><span class="black">Do you think that a particular buffer                        system can buffer any pH?

Imagine we have a buffer solution                    that is 1.0 M in both acetic acid and acetate. The pH of                    this system is &ndash; log 1.8 x                10<sup>&ndash;5</sup> = 4.74 (since [AcO&ndash;] = [AcOH]).                Now let us add some acid to this buffer; to make calculations                easy we will add 0.01 mol HCl to 1.0 L of buffer solution. What                happens? The major species in the buffer solution are acetic                acid and acetate and water, (hydronium ion and hydroxide ion                are minor components), and we have to decide which one will react                with HCl(aq). Just as in any acid-base reaction, it is more likely                that the base will react with the acid - that is the acetate                part of the buffer will react with the H+. </p>            <p class="black">The resulting reaction                will be: H+ +  &ndash;OAc &harr; AcOH + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />                <br />                That is the acetate concentration will decrease and the acetic acid                will increase. We can write the reaction down and calculate the            initial (before reaction) and final (after reaction) concentrations.<br />            <br />            <img src="graphics/ch9-tabel1.jpg" width="615" height="149" /><br>            The pH of this system can be calculated from the          Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:<br />                pH = pKa + log (0.99/1.01) = 4.73. <br />                <br />                That is the pH has hardly budged! (recall that the pH of 0.01                M HCl is 2.0). Even if we add more acid, for example 0.1 mol                HCl to our liter of buffer, the resulting pH will not change                much (it will be pH = 4.74 + log (0.90/1.10) = 4.65). Note that                the addition of acid has moved the pH in the direction we would                expect. That is: the addition of acid has made the pH of the                solution slightly more acidic (with a lower pH) but nowhere near                the pH of the solution if we had added the HCl directly to 1L                of water. <br />                <br />                We can also think about what happens when we add a strong base                to the buffer solution. If we add 0.01 mol sodium hydroxide to                our liter of buffer, we can calculate what the new pH will be.                Now the &ldquo;active&rdquo; component of the buffer will be                the acid, and the reaction can be written:<br />                <br />            HOAc + &ndash;OH &harr; AcO&ndash;  + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>            <p class="black">that is the strong base will react with the weak acid. The acid                concentration will fall, and its conjugate base concentration              will rise. <br />                <br />            <img src="graphics/ch9-table2.jpg" width="617" height="137" /></p>            <p class="black">the new pH of the solution is pH = 4.74 + log (1.01/0.99) = 4.75                - a slight increase - but hardly detectable. Note that the pH            of a 0.01 M solution of NaOH would be 12. </p>            <p class="black">So, buffers can keep the pH of a solution remarkably constant                - which as we will see if very important for biological systems,                but the question arises - just how much acid could we add to                the system before the pH does change appreciably, or rather,                enough to influence the behavior of the system? In biological                systems, this tolerance is fairly low - changes in pH can cause                a cascade of reactions that may prove catastrophic for the organism.                Almost all biomolecules contain groups that are sensitive to                pH. That is: they contain weakly acidic (carboxylic acid groups)                or basic (amino) groups, groups that can donate or accept a proton,                respectively. Because they are weak acids and basis, their behavior                is highly pH dependent.. </p>            <p class="black"> The amount of acid or base that a buffer solution can absorb                is called its buffering capacity. It depends on the original                concentrations of conjugate acid and base in the buffer and their                ratio after reaction: that is [conjugate acid]/[conjugate base].                If you start with a buffer that has equal amounts of acid and                base this ratio is equal to 1.0. As the ratio moves further away                from 1.0 the pH will be affected more and more, until the pH                changes out of the desired range. </p>            <p class="black"> Another important property of buffers is                    the range of pH that they can act over. As we have seen from                    the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when the concentration                    of acid = concentration of base, the pH of the solution =                    pKa of the acid, so the acetic acid/acetate buffer has a                    pH = 4.74. Generally, the effective buffering range is +1                    or &ndash; 1 pH unit around the pKa, meaning that the acetic                acid/acetate acts as an effective buffer in the range of pH 3.7                - 5.7, well within the acidic pH region. While there are biological                compartments (the stomach, lysosomes, and endosomes) that are                acidic, the major biological fluids (cytoplasm, blood/plasma)                have pHs around 7.2-7.4. In these systems buffering is done by                phosphate or carbonate buffer systems. For example, the phosphate                buffer system is composed mainly of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> as                the proton donor (acid), and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&ndash;</sup> as the proton                acceptor (base)<br />              <br />                H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>  + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&ndash;</sup>  H<sub>3</sub>O+<br />                <br />                It is important to see that what counts as an acid or a base                depends entirely on the reaction system you are studying. Both                H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&ndash;  and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&ndash;</sup> can                act as either an acid or base (try writing out the reactions),                depending upon the pH. But at physiological pH (7.2-7.4) the                predominant forms are H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&ndash;  and                HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&ndash;</sup>sup>. The pKa of the conjugate acid is 6.86                - so it makes sense that this buffer system is active in cellular        fluids.</p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><hr size="1" noshade />            <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>            <ul>                <li><span class="black">How much acid would you have to add to change the pH of a                    buffer that is 1.0 M in acid and conjugate base by 1 full                pH unit? </span></li>                <li><span class="black">If the buffer were 0.1M in acid and conjugate                        base would you have to add the same amount of acid?

This is particularly                    important in biological systems where there are many weakly                    acidic or basic groups that can be affected by the pH. For                    example, proteins contain both weakly acidic &ndash;COOH                    and weakly basic &ndash;NH<sub>2</sub> groups. At physiological pH (~7).                    For a simple carboxylic acid like acetic acid (and it turns                    out that most carboxylic acids behave in a similar way),                    a 1.0 M solution of has a pH of ~ 3.8. If we manipulate the                    pH (for example by adding a strong base), the acid reacts                    with the base to form an acetate ion. Based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch                    equation, when [acetate] = [acetic acid], the pH equals the                    acid&rsquo;s pKa - that is 4.74. As the pH increases further,                    [acetate] must also increase, until by pH ~7, the [acetic                    acid] is very small indeed. The ratio of base to acid is                    about 200/1. That is at physiological pHs groups such as                    carboxylic acids are deprotonated and exist in the carboxylate                    (negatively charged) form. <br />            Conversely, if we look at the amino group (&ndash;NH<sub>2</sub>)            of a protein, it is actually the base part of a conjugate acid base            pair in which the acid is the protonated form &ndash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>.            The pKa of an  &ndash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>            group is typically ~9. Meaning that at a pH of 9 there are equal            amounts of the protonated (&ndash; NH<sub>2</sub>) and unprotonated            (&ndash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>)            forms. If we lower the pH,by adding strong acid for example, the            concentration of &ndash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> form increases as the the            base form &ndash;NH<sub>2</sub> is protonated. At pH ~ 7 there is            little of the &ndash;NH<sub>2</sub> form remaining.</p>          <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td width="32%"><span class="black">Interestingly this means that an amino acid                    - as pictured here, can never exist in the predominant form                    where both the amino (&ndash;NH<sub>2</sub>) group and the                    carboxylic acid (&ndash;CO<sub>2</sub>H) exist                at the same time. </span></td>                <td width="68%"><img src="graphics/ch9-4.jpg" width="502" height="123" /></td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="black">The &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; species is in fact                the one in which &ndash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>/&ndash;CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>are                present at the same time.

For example: if these groups are protonated or                deprotonated, the electronic environment in that region of the                protein can change drastically, which may mean that the protein                will not only change how it interacts with other species, but                its shape may change so as to minimize repulsive interactions                or produce new attractive interactions. Small changes protein                shape can have profound effects on how the protein interacts            with other molecules and, if it is a catalyst, its efficiencyand specificity.
