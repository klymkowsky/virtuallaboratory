In many cases there is not a            smooth transition from reactants to products with a single transition            state and activation energy, as we have been (simplistically) portraying            it, but rather a series of steps, each with their own transition            state and activation energy. Here, we will only consider one step            and two step reactions, but in reality there could be many distinct            steps from reactant to product. Each step represents a kind of subreaction,            with its own activation energy and equilibrium state. The kinetics            of a reaction is generally determined by the slowest of these subreactions            - if forms a kind of &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; or &ldquo;rate-limiting step&rdquo;. </p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">          <tr>          <td width="66%" class="black">The reaction between methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) and hydroxide (&ndash;OH)        is a one step reaction, that involves a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide        on the carbon.

Well the rate equation: rate = k [CH<sub>3</sub>Br] [&ndash;OH]tells us that the rate depends on both reactants, and we also know the rate dependson k - which is related to the height of the activation energy barrier. Whatthis equation tells us is that in the transition state (the species at the highestenergy on the energy profile) both reactants are present.

This results in a positively charged carbon (the bromine takes all the electrons and becomes bromide ion) - a very unstable (but distinct) species known as a carbocation. </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td width="81%" class="black"><br />The resulting carbocation is intermediate, it sits in an energy well between      two less stable states.

The important point here is that ideas about how the reaction proceeds      can be deduced from the kinetic rate data on each reaction.</td>        <td width="19%"><img src="graphics/ch8-13.jpg" width="176" height="200" /></td>      </tr>    </table>    <p>The rate equation gives us information about what reactants are present in the rate determining step of the reaction.
