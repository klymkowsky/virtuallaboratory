Is this always the case with all salts? &ndash; again,            sadly enough, it is not. If you dissolve calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>)            or magnesium chloride (MgCl<sub>2</sub>), compounds commonly used            to prevent ice formation on roads, the solution gets warmer - not            colder. Dissolving CaCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> in water            clearly involves some kind of energy release, if the temperature            increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the solution            will have increased. <br />            <br />How do we explain the observation that dissolving NaCl causes the temperature    of the solution to decrease, while dissolving CaCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> makes    the temperature increase?<br />        </p></td>    <td width="16">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="190"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter6txt.html" target="_self">6.1 Solutions </a><br />        <a href="chapter6txt-2.html" target="_self">6.2 Solubility </a><br />        <a href="chapter6txt-3.html">6.3 H-bonds</a><br />        <strong>6.4       Free Energy</strong><br />      <a href="chapter6txt-5.html" target="_self">6.5 Polarity</a><br />      <a href="chapter6txt-6.html" target="_self">6.6 Temperature</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td class="black">Since both processes occur (all these compounds are highly soluble in water), the &Delta;G&rsquo;s for the formation of all three solutions must be negative. Let us begin with calcium chloride: as a crystal of CaCl<sub>2</sub> dissolves in water, interactions between ions are broken and new interactions between and water molecules and ions and formed. The table below lists the types of interactions involved in the crystal and the solvent.  Within the crystal, there are ion-ion interaction while in the solvent there are H-bonding, dipole-dipole, and van der Waals interactions.  As the crystal dissolves, new ion-dipole interactions between calcium ions and water molecules, and between chloride ions and molecules form.  At the same time, the majority of the interactions between water molecules are preserved. <br /><br />In order to connect our observation that the temperature increases with thermodynamic data, we have to be explicit about what we are considering the system and what is the surroundings. In this instance, the system is the CaCl<sub>2</sub> and the water molecules it interacts with. The surroundings are the rest of the water molecules (that is, the solution). So when we measure the temperature change, we are actually measuring the temperature change of the surroundings (not the system). If the temperature rises, that means thermal energy is transferred from the CaCl<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O system to the water. Therefore the interactions after the solution is formed are stronger (more stable) than those for the solid CaCl<sub>2</sub> and water separated. If we look up the enthalpy change for the solution of calcium chloride it is around -80&deg; kJ/mol. That is the dissolving is exothermic and heat is transferred from the system to the surroundings. </td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><span class="black"><img src="graphics/ch6-table2.jpg" width="740" height="139" alt="table" /></span></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr>        <td><p> <span class="black">So what is going on with NaCl?  Since solution temperatures decrease when NaCl is dissolved, the solution (surroundings) has lost energy to the the ion-solvent interactions (system). Energy from the surroundings is being used to break up the NaCl lattice and so allow ions to move into the solution. That would imply that ion-ion and H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>O interactions are stronger than the ion-water interactions for the NaCl-H<sub>2</sub>O system. The question then, is why does NaCl dissolve at all? The answer is that enthalpy is (yet  again) not the critical factor determining whether this process happens - it is of course  entropy.  If we factor in the entropy change for the solution, which in this case is positive, then &Delta;G is negative - this is an &ldquo;entropy driven&rdquo; reaction! </span></p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="534"><p class="black">To recap: for a solution to be formed,                the free energy change must be negative. When calcium chloride                dissolves in water &Delta;H is negative and &Delta;S is positive                - the result is a large negative &Delta;G - and a very high solubility                (595 g/L). In contrast when sodium chloride dissolves &Delta;H                is positive, but &Delta;S is positive enough to overcome the                effect of &Delta;H, meaning that the free energy change is also                negative for this process. In fact many solutes dissolve in water                with a decrease in temperature. Ethanol - which is infinitely                soluble in water has an unfavorable enthalpy of solution; the                entropy of mixing is the important factor<br />        </p></td>        <td width="16">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="190"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter6txt.html" target="_self">6.1                    Solutions </a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-2.html" target="_self">6.2 Solubility </a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-3.html">6.3 H-bonds</a><br />            <strong>6.4 Free Energy</strong><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-5.html" target="_self">6.5 Polarity</a><br />            <a href="chapter6txt-6.html" target="_self">6.6 Temperature</a><br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul><li class="black"> Predict the signs of &Delta;H, &Delta;S and &Delta;G for dissolving ammonium chloride in water (the temperature of the solution drops)</li>        <li class="black">Calcium phosphate (Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is insoluble in water.
