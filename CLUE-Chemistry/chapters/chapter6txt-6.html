Based on your experience,            it would be reasonable to assume that increasing temperature increases            solubility. But remember both &Delta;H and &Delta;S have a role,            and a temperature increase will increase the effects of changes in            entropy. While dissolving solute into solvent is likely to increase            entropy (if &Delta;S is positive), this is not always the case. Consider            what happens when you heat up water on the stove. Long before the            water reaches its boiling point, bubbles of gas are released from            the liquid.

The reason can be traced          back to the entropy of solution. Most gases have very small intermolecular          attractions (that is why the gas molecules don&rsquo;t stick together          and form solids and liquids), and therefore tend not to have very high          solubility in water. As an example, the solubility of O<sub>2</sub> in water is          8.3 mg/L (25 &ordm;C and 1 atmosphere.)</p>      <p align="left" class="black"><img src="graphics/ch6-8.jpg" width="504" height="98" /><br />        <br />    Most gases have a small favorable (that is negative) enthalpy of solution and small unfavorable negative entropy of solution. The effect on enthalpy can be traced to the dipole induced dipole attractions formed when the gas dissolves in the solution. The decrease in entropy results from the fact that the gas molecules are no longer free to roam around &ndash; their positional entropy is more constrained within the liquid phase that it is in the gaseous phase. When temperature is increased, the gas molecules have more kinetic energy and more of them can escape from the solution, increasing their entropy as they go back to the gas phase. Thus the solubility of O<sub>2</sub> (and other gases) decreases as temperature increases. This can produce environmental problems, since this means that less oxygen is available for organisms in the water to breathe. A common example of this type of thermal pollution occurs when warm water from power plants and manufacturing facilities is expelled into the environment.</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">Can you convert the solubility of O<sub>2</sub> in water into molarity (moles solute (O<sub>2</sub>) / liter solution)?</li>        <li class="black">If solubility of gases depends on dipole-induced dipole            interactions, what do you think the trend in solubility for the noble            gases is?

Upon re-solidification the atoms          are now fixed in space relative to each other and the resulting alloy          will have different properties than the two separate metals. One of          the first known alloys was bronze; the major component of which is          copper, with tin as the minor component (although other elements such          as arsenic or phosphorus may also be included). The &ldquo;Bronze Age&rdquo;          was a significant leap forward in human history: bronze is harder and          more durable than copper, and therefore artifacts (weapons, pots, statues          etc) made from bronze were prized. Before this, the only metals available          were those that occurred naturally in their elemental form &ndash; typically          silver, copper, and gold. <br />        <br />    Bronze (which is typically a solution of about 90% copper and 10% tin) is harder and more durable than copper because the tin atoms substitute for copper atoms in the solid lattice. The resulting structure has stronger metallic bonds &ndash; making the alloy harder and less deformable, and with a higher melting point than the copper itself. However the bronze alloy retains the typical metallic properties &ndash; since the structure is still that of a metal, with some of the atoms replaced by a different metal. Steel is another example of a solid-solid solution. Steel can be described as an iron solvent with carbon solute. In this case the carbon atoms do not replace the iron atoms, but fit in the spaces between them (this is often called an interstitial alloy). This has the effect of making steel more dense than iron (more atoms per unit volume), harder, and less metallic. Since the carbon atoms are not in the original lattice, they affect the metallic properties more, making it harder for the atoms to move relative to each other.  Steel is more rigid, less malleable, and conducts electricity and heat less effectively than iron. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul><li class="black">Why do you think silver, copper and gold often occur naturally as elements?

The question arises -      is the formation of a solution a chemical reaction? As we have so often      seen the answer is not so simple. For example if we dissolve ethanol in      water does this mixture contain chemically different species than the two      components separately? The answer is no, there are still molecules of ethanol      and molecules of water. But what about when an ionic substance dissolves      in water? For example, sodium chloride must separates into sodium and chloride      ions in order to dissolve. Is that a reaction? Certainly bonds are broken      (Na+ Cl&ndash; ionic bonds), and new interactions are made (solvated Na+      and Cl&ndash; ions), but traditionally this would not have classified the      dissociation of a salt as a reaction, even though it would seems to fit      our criteria. There are arguments on both sides, but rather than quibble      about what constitutes a reaction, let us move one place down the spectrum      of possible changes and look at what happens when you dissolve a molecular      species in water and it forms ions.</p>      <p class="black"> When you dissolve hydrogen chloride (HCl), a white choking          gas, in water you get an entirely new chemical substance: hydrochloric          acid (or muriatic acid as it is known in hardware stores), one of the          common strong acids. This reaction can be written: HCl(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; HCl          (aq). <br />          <br />          This is a bit of short hand because we begin with lots of water, and          not much of it is used in the reaction. We indicate this fact by using          the (aq) symbol for aqueous, which implies that the HCl molecules are          dissolved in water. At the same time it is important to recognize that          Hydrochloric acid, HCl (aq) has properties that are quite distinct        from those of gaseous hydrogen chloride HCl(g).</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="536"><p class="black"> The processes by which hydrochloric                acid is formed are somewhat similar to those that form a solution                of sodium chloride, except that in this case it is the covalent                bond between H and Cl that is broken, and a new covalent bond                is formed between H and O.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>            <p class="black">HCl(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; H<sub>3</sub>O+ +                Cl&ndash;<br />                <br />                We call this reaction an acid-base reaction.
