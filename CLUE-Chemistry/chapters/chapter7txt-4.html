The first step in this pathway often          involves Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions between specific regions          of the molecules involved. Of course, whether or not such Coulombic          interactions are stable depends upon the kinetic energies of the colliding          molecules and how, exactly, they collide with one another. Catalysts,          which speed reactions, often do so by controlling how molecules collide          with, or interact with one another. So for example: in the reaction          of H<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub>, the positive end of one molecule          interacts with the negative end of the other.

For example:          why does an increase in pH correspond to a decrease in &ldquo;acidity&rdquo; and          why does pH change with temperature? How do we make sense of pH and          use that information to better understand chemical systems? <br />          <br />    The key idea about pH is that that water undergoes an acid-base reaction    with itself. Recall that this reaction involves the transfer of a proton    from one water molecule to another. The proton is never free or &ldquo;alone&rdquo;,    it is always bonded to an oxygen within an water molecule. The other important    point is that this reaction is readily reversible; that means under normal    conditions (room temperature) the reaction proceeds in both directions (you    might want to justify how this is possible, given your understanding of bonding    - remember, that the reaction occurs within the context of a solution of    water molecules, and that these molecules have and can receive kinetic energy.)    If we look at the reaction, it makes intuitive sense that the reactants on    the right (H<sub>3</sub>O+ and &ndash;OH) can react together to give two    H<sub>2</sub>O molecules &ndash; simply because of the interaction of the    positive and negative charges. This is one of the first examples we have    seen of a reaction that can and does go both in forward and backwards in    the same system and as we will see, all reactions are reversible at the nanoscale    (we will consider the implications of this fact in detail in the next chapter).    In any sample of pure water there are three different types of molecules:    water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O+) and hydroxide    ions (&ndash;OH).  What is more, these three species are constantly interacting    with each other through the formation of relatively weak H-bonds, which are    constantly forming and breaking. Remember, in liquid water, where the concept    of pH makes sense, the water molecules are in constant motion, constantly    colliding with one another. Some of these collisions have enough energy to    break the covalent H-O bond in water or hydronium, simultaneously transferring    H+ forming a new bond with either another water molecule, to form hydronium    ion, or with a hydroxide ion, to form a water molecule. To get a feeling    for how dynamic this process is, it is estimated that the average lifetime    of an individual hydronium ion is on the order of 1-2 picoseconds (1x10<sup>&ndash;12</sup>    ps), an essentially unimaginable short period of time. In pure water, at    25 &deg;C, the average concentration of hydronium ions is 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;7</sup>    mol/L. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="441"><span class="black">We use brackets to indicate concentration, and so we write this as [H<sub>3</sub>O+] = 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;7</sup> M.

It must also be the case that the product of the hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations, [H<sup>3</sup>O+][&ndash;OH], is, at a particular temperature, a constant. This constant is a property of water, and at 25&ordm;C this constant is 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;14</sup>, and given the symbol Kw,25&ordm;C. So why do we care? Because, when we add an acid or a base to a solution of water at 25&ordm;C, the product of [H<sub>3</sub>O+][&ndash;OH] remains the same, 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;14</sup>. We can use this fact in better understanding the behavior of acids, bases, and aqueous solutions. </span></p>      <p class="black"> For many people, dealing with negative exponents does          not come naturally, that is, their implications and manipulations can          be difficult. Believe it or not, the pH scale was designed to make          dealing with exponents easier, but it does require that you understand          how to work with logarithms (perhaps an equally difficult task). pH          is defined as pH =  &ndash; log [H<sub>3</sub>O+].In pure water (at          25&ordm;C),          where the [H<sub>3</sub>O+] = 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;7</sup> M, pH = 7 (pH          has no units). A solution with a higher concentration of hydronium          ions than pure water is acidic while a solution with a higher concentration          of hydroxyl ions is basic. This leads to the (perhaps) counter-intuitive          fact that as acidity [H<sub>3</sub>O+] goes up, pH goes down. See for          yourself, calculate the pH of a solution with a [H<sub>3</sub>O+] of          1 x 10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> M, and of 1 x 10<sup>&ndash;6</sup>          M. Moreover, because it is logarithmic, a unit change in pH corresponds          to a change in [H<sub>3</sub>O+] of a factor of 10. The pH scale is          commonly thought of as spanning units 1-14, but in fact many (very)          strong acid solutions have pH &lt; 1. Pictures of the pH scale (such          as the one below) often use colors to indicate the change in pH. This          convention began because there are many ?compounds that change color          depending on the [H<sub>3</sub>O+]          of the solution in which they are dissolved. For example litmus          is red when dissolved in an acidic (pH &lt; 7) solution, and blue when          in a basic (pH &gt;7) solution.   Perhaps you have notice that when          you add lemon juice (which is acidic) to tea, the color changes. Don&rsquo;t          get confused, solutions of acids and bases do not intrinsically differ          in terms of color. When there is a color change, it depends on the          nature of molecules dissolved in the solution; you might even feel          able to suggest how changes in pH could effect molecular structure,          and so the interactions between molecules and light (a topic we hope        to return to in chapter 10.)</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><span class="black"><img src="graphics/ch7-12.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="109" /></span></td>        <td><span class="black">It is important to note that at 37 &ordm;C the                value of Kw is different - [H<sub>3</sub>O+][&ndash;OH] = 2.5 x 10<sup>&ndash;14</sup>                and therefore the pH is 6.8, but (weirdly) this does not mean        that the solution is acidic, since [H<sub>3</sub>O+] = [&ndash;OH]. </span></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><span class="black">While the effect is small it is significant and                it means that a pH of 7 does not always mean that a solution                is acidic (it depends on the temperature.)

We can ignore the H<sub>3</sub>O+ present initially in the water. Why?  Because it was 6 orders of magnitude (0.0000001)(10<sup>-7</sup>) smaller than the H+ derived from the HCl (10-1).  It is rare to see pH measurements with more than three significant figures, so the H<sub>3</sub>O+ originally present in the water does not have a significant effect on the measured pH value. Although we are not (generally) concerned about the amount of hydroxide &ndash; it            is worth noting that <br />            [H<sub>3</sub>O+][&ndash;OH] remains a constant (Kw) &ndash; when            [H<sub>3</sub>O+]            increases [&ndash;OH] decreases. <br />        <br>        While a number of substances dissolve in water, not all ionize, and not all substances that ionize alter the pH.

The obvious question is why the pH of a 0.1M                solution of acetic acid is different from the pH of 0.1M solution                of hydrochloric acid? The explanation lies in the fact that acetic                acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) does not dissociate completely into                CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;  and H<sub>3</sub>O+ when                it is dissolved in water. A pH of 2.8 indicates that the [H<sub>3</sub>O+]                = 10<sup>&ndash;2.8</sup>;  this number can converted into 1.6                x 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>                M. About 1.6% of the added acetic acid is ionized (a form known                as acetate ion, CH<sub>3</sub>COO&ndash;), the rest is in the                protonated form (acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH). That said, the specific                molecules that are ionized changes all the time - protons are                jumping on and off (or better put constantly transferring from                one oxygen to another). You can think of this process in another                way; it is the system that has a pH, not individual molecules.                If we were able to look at a single molecule of acetic acid in                the solution, we would find that it would be ionized 1.6% of                the time. This may seem a weird way to think about the system,                but remember, many biological systems (e.g bacteria) are quite                small, with a volume of only a few cubic microns or micrometers                (a cubic micron is a cube 10<sup>&ndash;6</sup> m on a side) and may contain                a rather small number of any one type of molecule. It can be                useful to think not of the bulk behavior of these molecules (since                their are so relatively few of them), but the behavior of individual                molecules, averaged over time. We often indicate the extent to                which a reaction occurs through the lengths of the arrows between                the two forms the un-ionized (neutral) and ionized. Again, in                an aqueous solution of acetic acid molecules, that means most                (98.4%) of the molecules are in the un-ionized form and for any                particularly molecule, it will be un-ionized most (98.4%) percent                of the time.<br />                <br />        We can measure the pH of solutions of many acids of known concentrations, and from these measurements make estimates of the strength of the acid. Strong acids, such as nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric all are totally ionized in solution.  Weaker acids, such as organic acids, ionize to a much lesser extent. That said, given the low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in pure water, even weak acids can significantly alter the pH of an aqueous solution. The same behavior applies to weak bases. <br />        <br />        </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="513"><p class="black1"><span class="black">Many biological                    molecules contain parts (called moieties) that behave as                    weak acids or weak bases. The pH of the solution in which                    these molecules find themselves will therefore influence                    the extent to which these moieties are ionized. Whether a                    moiety is ionized or not can dramatically influence a biomolecule&rsquo;s                    behavior, that is, its structure and its interactions with                    other molecules. It is because of this fact that changes                    in pH can have dramatic effects on biological system; for                    example, if the pH of your blood changes by less than +0.3                    or &ndash;0.3 one pH unit, you are likely to die. Biological                    systems spend much of the energy they use maintaining a constant                    pH (typically around 7.35-7.45.) In addition, the pH within                    your cells is tightly regulated, and can influence cellular        behavior. </span></p></td>        <td width="12">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="215"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter7txt.html" target="_self">7.1                    Reactions </a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-2.html" target="_self">7.2 Types (Acid-Base)</a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-3.html" target="_self">7.3 Lewis Acid-Base</a><br />            <strong>7.4 Nucleo- &amp; Electrophiles</strong><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-5.html" target="_self">7.5 Oxidation-Reduction</a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-6.html" target="_self">7.6 Energetics</a><br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul><li><span class="black">Carboxylic acid groups, &ndash;COOH, are common in large biomolecules.
