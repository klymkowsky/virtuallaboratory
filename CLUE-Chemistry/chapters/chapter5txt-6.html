The problem with this is that we are all well aware of changes where the entropy apparently decreases. How can we resolve this seeming paradox? The answer lies in the fact that for any system the entropy may indeed decrease - water freezing is an example of this phenomenon. However for the universe as a whole (or more easily defined, the system and its surroundings) total entropy must increase.  Consider when water freezes, the water molecules form stable interactions (hydrogen bonds). As we have seen previously, the formation of stabilizing interactions lowers the potential energy of the system.  Because energy is conserved, this energy must be released to the surroundings as thermal (kinetic) energy.  That is, the freezing of water is an exothermic process. <br />      <br />    Now we can see the solution to our thermodynamic problem. The reason that    the freezing of water does not violate the second law is because even though    the system (ice) becomes more ordered and has lower entropy, the energy that    is released to the surroundings makes those molecules move faster, which    leads to an increase in the entropy of the surroundings. The increase in    entropy in the surroundings is greater than the decrease in entropy of the    ice! When we consider both system and surroundings, the change in entropy    (&Delta;S) is positive. The Second Law is preserved (yet again), but only    when we actively embrace systems thinking. </p>      <p><span class="black"><strong>Free Energy to the Rescue</strong></span></p>      <p class="black">This idea, that we must consider changes in entropy for both the system and its surroundings when we are predicting which way a change will occur (that is, in which direction a process is thermodynamically favorable) is an important one. However, it is almost always easier to look at the system than it is to look at the surroundings (after all we define the system as that part of the universe we are studying.)  It would therefor be much more convenient to use criteria for change that refer only to the system. Fortunately there is a reasonably simple way to do this. Let us think about water freezing again: we can measure the enthalpy change for this process. The thermal energy change for the system, &Delta;Hfreezing, is about -6 kJ/mole. That is 6 kJ of thermal energy are released into the surroundings for every mole of water that freezes. We can relate this thermal energy release to the entropy change of the surroundings.  Entropy is measured in units of J/K &ndash; that is energy/temperature. Since we know how much energy is added to the surroundings we can calculate the entropy change that this energy produces. </p>      <p class="black">Mathematically we can express this as &Delta;Ssurroundings = &Delta;Hsurroundings/T.  And since we know that &Delta;Hsystem =  -&Delta;Hsurroundings, (that is: the energy lost by the system = minus (-) the energy gained by the surroundings) we can express the entropy change of the surroundings in terms of measurable variables for the system. That is &Delta;Ssurroundings = -&Delta;Hsystem/T. <br>        <br />        If you recall, we can express the total entropy change (the one the second law &rdquo;cares&rdquo; about) as &Delta;Stotal = &Delta;Ssystem + &Delta;Ssurroundings. Substitute for the &Delta;Ssurroundings term, we get &Delta;Stotal = &Delta;Ssystem -&Delta;Hsystem/T.    At this point, we have an equation that involves only variables that relate to the system, these are much easier to measure and calculate. We can rearrange the equation by multiplying throughout by -T, to get  -T&Delta;Stotal = &Delta;Hsystem-T&Delta;Ssystem</p>      <p class="black"> The quantity -T&Delta;Stotal has units of energy, and is commonly known as the free energy change &Delta;G (or the Gibbs Free energy). The equation is normally written as: &Delta;G = &Delta;H &ndash; T&Delta;S. The free energy change of a reaction is probably the most important thermodynamic term that you will need to learn about. In most biological and biochemical systems, it is &Delta;G that is commonly used to determine whether reactions are thermodynamically favorable. However, it is important to remember that &Delta;G is a proxy for the entropy change of the universe; if it is negative, universal entropy is increasing (and the reaction occurs), if it is positive, universal entropy would decrease if the reaction occurred (and so it does not).  It is possible however for reactions with a positive &Delta;G to occur, but only if they are coupled with a reaction with an even greater negative &Delta;G (see chapters 8 and 9). <br />        <br />      There are numerous tables of thermodynamic data in most texts and on many websites. Since we often want to use thermodynamic data such as &Delta;H, &Delta;S, and &Delta;G, it is useful to have some reference state. This is known as the standard state and is defined as 298 K temperature, 1 atmosphere pressure, 1M concentrations (room temperature and pressure). When thermodynamic data refer to the standard state they are given the superscript &ordm; (nought), so &Delta;H&ordm;, &Delta;S&ordm;, and &Delta;G&ordm; all refer to the standard state. However we often apply these data at temperatures other than 298 K - and while small errors might creep in the results are usually accurate enough.</p>      <p class="black"><strong>What is &ldquo;Free&rdquo; about Gibbs Free Energy?</strong></p>      <p class="black">The reason we use &Delta;G or &Delta;G&ordm; to describe many systems (and especially biological ones), is that both the magnitude and sign tell us a lot about how that system will behave. We use &Delta;G (the Gibbs free energy change) rather than &Delta;H (the enthalpy change) because &Delta;G tells us how much energy is actually available to bring about further change (or to do work). It factors out for us the energy produced from the change from what that is lost to the surroundings as increased entropy (and so is not available for us to use to do work.)  As an example, when wood is burnt,  it is theoretically impossible for all of the heat released to be used to do work, some of the energy goes to increase the entropy of the system. For any change in the system, some of the energy is always lost in this way to the surroundings; this is why it is impossible to build a machine that is 100% efficient in converting energy from one kind to another (although many have tried - google perpetual motion machines.) The term &ldquo;free energy&rdquo; then doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is literally free - but rather means what is theoretically available for further transformations.</p>      <p class="black"> When &Delta;G is negative, we know that the reaction will be thermodynamically favored.[Many people use the term spontaneous - but this is misleading since it infers that the reaction will happen right away. In fact &Delta;G tells us nothing about when the process will happen - only that it is favored. As we will see later the rate at which a process occurs is governed by other factors. ] The best case scenario is when &Delta;H is negative (an exothermic change - that is the system is losing energy to the surroundings and becoming more stable), and &Delta;S is positive - (that is the system is increasing in entropy). Because T is always greater than 0 (in degrees K), T&Delta;S  will be positive and this value will be subtracted from &Delta;H to given an even larger negative &Delta;G value.  A good example of such a process is the reaction (combustion) of sugar (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) with molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>):<br />        <br />        C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(s) + 6 O<sub>2</sub>(g)  &#8594;  6 CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O(g). </p>      <p class="black">This is an exothermic process and, as you can see from the reaction equation, it results in the production of more molecules than we started with (often a sign that entropy has increased.)<br>        <br />        A process such as this (-&Delta;H and + &Delta;S) is thermodynamically        favored at all temperatures. On the other hand an endothermic process        (+&Delta;H) and a decrease in entropy (-&Delta;S) will never occur as        an isolated reaction (Ah, but so few reactions are actually isolated        from the rest of the universe.) For example a reaction that combined        CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O to form sugar (the reverse reaction to the combustion above)        is never thermodynamically favored since &Delta;H is positive and &Delta;S        is negative, making &Delta;G always positive at all temperatures. Now        you may find yourself shaking your head - everyone knows that the formation        of sugars from carbon dioxide and water goes on all over the world right        now (in plants). The key here is that plants use energy from the sun.        <br />        <br />        The reaction is actually:<br />  &ldquo;captured energy&rdquo; +  6 CO<sub>2</sub>(g) +        6 H<sub>2</sub>O(g) &#8594; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(s) + 6 O<sub>2</sub>(g) + &ldquo;excess energy&rdquo; . <br />        <br />      Just because a process is thermodynamically unfavored doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can never occur; what it does mean is that that process cannot occur in an isolation, it must be &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; to other reactions.    </p><p class="black"><strong>Free energy, and temperature</strong></p>    <p class="black"> So we have two very clear cut cases that allow us to predict whether a process will occur - where the enthalpy and entropy predict the same outcome. But there are also two other situations where the enthalpy and entropy &ldquo;point&rdquo; in different directions. When this happens we need to use the fact that the free energy change is temperature dependent to predict the outcome. Recall the expression &Delta;G = &Delta;H &ndash; T&Delta;S depends upon temperature.  For a system where the entropy change is positive (+&Delta;S), an increase in temperature will lead to an increasingly negative contribution to &Delta;G.  That is, as the temperature rises - a process that involves an increase in entropy will become more favorable. Conversely, if the system change involves a decrease in entropy, (that is &Delta;S is negative) then &Delta;G will become more positive (and less favorable) as the temperature increases.<br>      <br />      This idea, that the temperature affects the direction of some processes is perhaps a little disconcerting - it goes against common sense that if you heat something up a reaction might actually stop and go backwards (and rest assured we will come back to this point later).  But in fact there are a number of common processes where we can apply this kind of reasoning and find that they make perfect sense. <br />      <br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="700" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><span class="black">&Delta;H </span></td>        <td><span class="black">&Delta;S </span></td>        <td><span class="black">&Delta;G</span></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><span class="black">Negative (exothermic) </span></td>        <td><span class="black">Positive (entropy increases)</span></td>        <td><span class="black">Negative at all temperatures<br />(always thermodynamically favored)        </span></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><span class="black">Positive (endothermic)</span></td>        <td><span class="black">Negative (entropy decreases)</span></td>        <td><span class="black">Positive at all temperature<br />(never thermodynamically favored)</span>`</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><span class="black">Negative (exothermic) </span></td>        <td><span class="black">Negative (entropy decreases)</span></td>        <td><span class="black">Depends on the temperature, as the temperature                increases  &Delta;G will become more positive and the reaction        will become less favored (go backwards)</span></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><span class="black">Positive (endothermic) </span></td>        <td><span class="black">Positive (entropy increases) </span></td>        <td><span class="black">Depends on the temperature, as the temperature                increases  &Delta;G will become more negative and the reaction        will become favored (go forwards)</span></td>    </tr></table><table width="700" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><p class="black">Up to this point, we have been considering physical                changes to a system, that is populations of molecules going from                solid to liquid or liquid to gaseous states (and vice versa).                Not really what one commonly thinks of as chemistry, but the                fact is that these transformations involve the making and breaking                of interactions between molecules. We can therefore consider                phase transitions as analogous to chemical reactions, and because                they are somewhat simpler, develop logic that applies to both                processes. So let us begin by considering a phase change/reaction                system H<sub>2</sub>O (liquid) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O (gas). </p>            <p class="black">We use a double arrow &harr; to indicate that, depending upon                the conditions, the reaction could go either to the right (boiling)                or to the left (condensing). So, let us assume for the moment                that we do not already know that water boils (changes from liquid                to gas) at 100&ordm;C, what factors would determine whether the                reaction H<sub>2</sub>O (liquid) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O (gas) favors the liquid or the                gaseous state at a particular temperature? As we have seen the                criterion for whether a process will &ldquo;go&rdquo; at a particular                temperature is &Delta;G. We also know that the free energy change                for a reaction going in one direction is the negative of the &Delta;G                for the reaction going in the opposite direction. So that, the &Delta;G            for the reaction:</p>          <p class="black">H<sub>2</sub>O (liquid) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O (gas) is &ndash;&Delta;G          for the reaction H<sub>2</sub>O (gas) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O (liquid). </p>            <p class="black">When water boils all the intermolecular attractions between the                    water molecules must be overcome, allowing the water molecules                    to fly off into the gaseous phase. Therefore the process                    of water boiling is endothermic (&Delta;Hvaporization = +40.65                    kJ/mol); it requires an energy input from the surroundings                    (when you put a pot of water on the stove you have to turn                    on the burner for it to boil). When the water boils, the                    entropy change is quite large (&Delta;Svaporization = 109                    J/mol K), as the molecules go from being relatively constrained                    in the liquid to gas molecules that can fly around. At temperatures                    lower than the boiling point the enthalpy term predominates                    and &Delta;G is positive, but as you increase the temperature                    in your pan of water, eventually it reaches a point where                    the contributions to &Delta;G of &Delta;H and T&Delta;S are                    equal. That is &Delta;G goes from being positive to negative                    and the process becomes favorable. At the temperature where                    this &ldquo;cross over&rdquo; occurs &Delta;G = 0 and &Delta;H                    = T&Delta;S. At this temperature (373 K, 100 &ordm;C) water                    boils (at 1 atmosphere). At temperatures above the boiling                    point &Delta;G is always negative and water will exist predominantly                    in the gas phase. However if we let the temperature drop                    below the boiling point, the enthalpy term becomes predominant                    again and &Delta;G for boiling is positive - that is: water                    will not boil at temperatures below 100 &ordm;C (at one atmosphere).<br />    <br />                Let us now consider a different phase change, for example water                freezing. In this case as the water molecules in the liquid start                to aggregate and form hydrogen bonds with each other, energy                is released to the surroundings (remember it is this energy that                is responsible for increasing the entropy of the surroundings.)                Therefore &Delta;H is negative - freezing is an exothermic process                (&Delta;H<sub>fusion</sub> = &ndash; 6 kJ/mol.) However freezing is also                a process that reduces the system entropy. When water molecules                are constrained, as in ice, their positional entropy is reduced.                So water freezing is a process that is favored by the change                in enthalpy and disfavored by the change in entropy. As the temperature                falls, the entropy term contributes less to &Delta;G, and eventually                (at the cross over point) &Delta;Gfusion goes to zero and then                becomes negative - that is the process becomes thermodynamically            favored. </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="550"><p class="black">Water freezes at temperatures below                0 &ordm;C.
