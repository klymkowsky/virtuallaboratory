This tends to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; the molecule into specific orientations, which can influence the compound&rsquo;s    physical properties. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="586"><p class="black"><br />    An example of how structure interferes with the formation of a molecule is a molecule containing 17 Cs and 36 Hs; while possible to draw, this molecule has never been synthesized - the atoms crowd each other, particularly at the periphery.

Research indicates that students (that is, most people) have a tough time with this task, which is why we will describe various approaches here. </p>    <p class="black">Before we begin, we need to have some rules. Let us use the set of possible molecules that contain 5 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms - these are generically known as &ldquo;pentanes&rdquo;. You can begin with a piece of paper (and a pencil); how many different molecules can you draw with the composition of C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>?  Clearly C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> does not uniquely define the structure of the molecule &ndash; it is better to use their distinct names (pentane, isopentane, and neopentane). Each of the different molecules you have drawn have the same molecular formula but they have different shapes and, it turns out, different properties. For example, pentane has a boiling point of 308 K, whereas the boiling points of isopentane and neopentane are 301 K and and 283 K, respectively. Their shapes, rather than their elemental composition, influences the strength of the attractions between the individual molecules, which in turn influences their boiling points. We call these kinds of related compounds structural isomers - that is they have the same composition (e.g. C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) but their constituent atoms are connected differently to give different structures and shapes. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="586"><p class="black"><br />      It is common to use a number of different types of representations to represent molecules. One way is through what are known as text (or linear) formulas. In this scheme, pentane is written <br />CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>, which can also be written as CH<sub>3</sub>-[CH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>). This capturessome of the structural subtleties of pentane, but not all - it does not illustratethe fact that the molecule is not strictly linear, nevertheless we can alreadyanticipate complications - how would we write isopentane? The most obvious waywould be ((CH<sub>3</sub>)2CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>). Neopentane is written as ((CH<sub>3</sub>)4C)[does that makesense? - try deciphering them &ndash; we will return to this point later on inthis chapter). </p></td>    <td width="114"><img src="graphics/ch4-9.jpg" width="247" height="160" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td class="black">If we followed the logic of this approach, we could draw a more complete            representation of pentane, isopentane, and neopentane as Lewis structures,            but again, we are missing the three dimensionality - you might even            be led to think that the molecules are actually flat, when they are            much more like balls. While it is possible to make the representation            a little more realistic by trying to indicate three dimensionality            using the wedge and dash symbols, these structures become very complicated            very fast.
