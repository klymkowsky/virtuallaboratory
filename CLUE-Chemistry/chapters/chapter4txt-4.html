Nitrogen has seven electrons            (2 core and 5 valence)(1s2, 2s2, 2px1, 2py1, 2pz1).

One            factor is that nitrogen atoms are too small to support five centers            of electron density around themselves - the bonds begin to overlap,                which is destabilizing, just like we saw with bulky groups around                a carbon. Another factor is that there are only four orbitals                available in nitrogen in the second quantum shell - if nitrogen                were to form five bonds it would have to use orbitals from the                next quantum shell (3), but these orbitals are too high in energy                - the energy required would not be offset the energy released                upon on bond formation. Together these factors mean that nitrogen,                and in fact all elements in the second row of the periodic table                (periodic table tutorial), are limited to bonding arrangements                with no more than four centers of electron density. As we will                see later on elements in the next row, such as phosphorus (P)                and sulfur (S), are larger and have more available orbitals for        bonding &ndash; they can form up to six centers of electron density.</p>      <p class="black">The simplest compound of nitrogen is molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>.

Hydrogen fluoride, HF, has one bond, but four centers of electron density around the fluorine.

A confusing point is that the Lewis structure can be written in a number of apparently different ways, which are actually equivalent - the key to remember is that the Lewis structure does not attempt to depict that molecule&rsquo;s actual three dimensional structure. It is a short-hand that assumes you already know the arrangement of orbitals.  No matter how it is drawn, the actual structure of a H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is the same, there is always a 104.5&ordm; bond angle between the O-H bonds. All these structures are equivalent.<br />      <br />The tendency to form four centers (bonds or non-bonding pairs) has led to the rather misleading &ldquo;octet rule.&rdquo;  That is, some elements tend to form molecules that have 8 electrons around any atom (except for hydrogen.)  Unfortunately the octet rule is far from being a rule - since there are many exceptions - as we will see later (many of the elements past the second row of the periodic table are capable of bonding to more than 4 other atoms, and many elements form stable compounds with less than 8 electrons). It is important to remember that the octet rule is not the reason why atoms bond with each other. </p>    <p class="black"><strong>Polarized bonds and electronegativity</strong></p>    <p class="black"> Earlier we saw that the boiling points of hydrocarbons tends to increase as the number of carbons in the compound increases, and that molecules with similar molecular weights have similar, but not identical boiling points, with the shapes of the molecules having an effect, although a relatively small one. The attractions between hydrocarbons are due to London dispersion forces that depend on the size, surface area, and shape of the molecule. The larger these forces, the more strongly molecules will stick together and the more energy (higher temperature) will be needed to overcome these attractions.<br />      <br />    Let us consider the boiling points of some second row compounds involving bonds with hydrogen, that is, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and HF &ndash; these molecules are known as hydrides, and Neon (Ne), which does not form bonds with hydrogen (we will consider the hydrides of Li, Be and B later.)  They all have about the same molecular weight but different shapes.  Based on our experiences with hydrocarbons, we would be well justified in predicting that they would have somewhat similar boiling points. Unfortunately, this prediction is not supported by experimental evidence (TABLE below). There is no clear trend, so something is going on that we have not yet considered.  To explain this data we have to return to an idea that we discussed in chapter 3, namely that the size of atoms decreases as you go across a row of the periodic table.  Not only does the size (radius) of the atoms decrease (from 70 pm for C to 38 pm for Ne), so does the length of the bonds between the atoms and hydrogen (from 109 pm to 92 pm).  This is both surprising and counterintuitive (which is why we are reminding you about it!) </p></td>  </tr></table><p class="black"><img src="graphics/ch4-19.jpg" width="740" height="243" /> </p><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="426" class="black">Remember that the size of the atom is based on a balance between the attraction between the negatively charged electrons to the positively charged protons in the nucleus, the repulsions between the electrons as they get close to each other, and of course the arcane, but highly accurate rules of quantum mechanics.</td>    <td width="274"><img src="graphics/ch4-20.jpg" width="274" height="102" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black">The reason that the atom&rsquo;s size is decreasing as the number of protons increases is that each electron in the valence shell is attracted by an increasing number of protons in the nucleus.  The more protons, the larger this attractive force.</p><p class="black">At the same time, the electrons in the same valence shell don&rsquo;t tend to affect each other much - that is they don&rsquo;t repel each other as much as you might suspect, because they are in different orbitals.  Therefore the &ldquo;effective nuclear charge&rdquo; increases from right to left across the periodic table.   This increase in &ldquo;effective nuclear charge&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t just affect the electrons in isolated atoms - but also affects the electrons in bonds. The ability to attract the electrons in bonds is called electronegativity, and since it derives from the same effect as the effective nuclear charge and atomic radius, electronegativity also tends to increase from left to right across a row in the periodic table. It also decreases from top to bottom in a group of the periodic table - which makes sense - the further electrons are from the nucleus, the less they will be attracted. The exceptions to this rule are the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar etc), since they do not form bonds with other elements (under normal circumstances) their electronegativities are usually not reported.</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="595" class="black">Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and the Lewis structure of HF shows the one H-F bond and three lone pairs. Fluorine attracts electrons very strongly - even the ones in the H-F bond, so that the fluorine atom ends up with more than its fair share of electrons and hydrogen ends up with less. One way to think about this is that the electron density in the H&ndash;F bond is shifted closer to the F and away from the H.</td>    <td width="105"><img src="graphics/ch4-21.jpg" width="105" height="123" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p>The result of this is that the F has more negative charge            than positive charge, and the H has more positive than negative charge.            We indicate this by writing a &delta;&ndash; charge on the F and a &delta;+ charge on the H (&delta; is often used to denote a small increment).  That means that there is an unequal distribution of charge in the molecule.  The HF molecule has a permanent dipole; the H-F bond is said to be &ldquo;polarized&rdquo; and the molecule is considered &ldquo;polar&rdquo;. Permanent dipoles are different from the transient  dipoles associated with London dispersion forces. Because of their permanent dipoles, molecules of HF interact with one another, both attractively and repulsively, more strongly in some orientations than in others. HF molecules are attracted to each other much more strongly than say Ne atoms because of the presence of these permanent dipoles.  This results in a much higher boiling point for HF than for Ne (see table above). That is, much more energy has to be supplied to the system to separate HF molecules from each other, than is needed to separate Ne atoms.  An important point to note is that H&ndash;F            only has one bond, and the polarity of the bond is the same as the            polarity of the whole molecule, as we will see this is not the case        in molecules with more complex structures.<br />        <br />It is relatively easy to predict whether a particular bond is polar, by looking    at the electronegativity differences between the atoms in that bond. Typically    elements on the left hand side of the periodic table have rather low electronegativities,    and elements over toward the right hand side have higher electronegativities.    There are several ways to calculate electronegativities, but in general it    is not very useful to memorize specific numbers. However, it is helpful to    understand the trends and to be able to predict bond polarities. Since Fluorine    is the most electronegative element, it can be expected to make the most    polarized bonds with hydrogen. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="496"><p class="black">So let us take this logic a bit further,                if HF has the most polar bonds, the HF molecules should stick                together with the strongest attractions, and HF should have the                highest boiling point.
