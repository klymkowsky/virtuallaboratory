Under most circumstances (particularly                when the pressure and volume are kept constant) these changes                can be ascribed to changes in enthalpy &Delta;H. For example                combustion reactions (redox reactions involving oxygen) are a                major source of energy for most organisms. In warm blooded organisms,                the energy released through such reactions is used, in part,                to maintain a set body temperature. Within organisms, combustion                reactions occur as highly controlled steps (which is why you                do not burst into flames), through the process known as respiration.                As we will see later, this energy is harnessed by releasing it                during the course of a cascade of coupled reactions, rather than        all at once. </span></p></td>    <td width="17">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="215"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter7txt.html" target="_self">7.1 Reactions </a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-2.html" target="_self">7.2 Types (Acid-Base)</a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-3.html" target="_self">7.3 Lewis Acid-Base</a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-4.html" target="_self">7.4       Nucleo- &amp; Electrophiles</a><br />      <a href="chapter7txt-5.html" target="_self">7.5 Oxidation-Reduction</a><br />      <strong>7.6 Energetics</strong><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black">Not all biological forms of respiration use molecular            oxygen, there are other molecules that serve to accept electrons            - this process is known as anaerobic (air-free) respiration. That            said, all known organisms use the molecule adenosine triphosphate            (ATP) as a convenient place to store energy; ATP is synthesized from            adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. As two separate            species ADP and inorganic phosphate are more stable than ATP, and            the energy captured from the environment to make ATP can be released            again (with the formation of ADP and inorganic phosphate). <br />        ADP + Pi + energy &harr; ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />        <br />        ATP synthesis is another example of a electrophile-nucleophile interaction.        For all these type of reactions we can ask the same question, where (ultimately)        does the energy come from? That is: when an exothermic reaction occurs        and energy is transferred from the system to the surroundings (resulting        in a temperature increase in the surroundings and a negative enthalpy        change  &ndash; &Delta;H), what is exactly the source of the energy that        is transferred? (Of course you already know the answer, it has to be        the energy released when a bond is formed!) </p>      <p class="black"> The defining trait of a chemical reaction is a change in the chemical identity of the reactants, new types of molecules are produced. For this to be true, at least some of the bonds in the starting material must be broken, and new bonds must be formed in the products (otherwise no reaction would have occurred). So to analyze energy changes in chemical reactions we look at which bonds get broken and which are formed, and compare their energies. As we will discuss later, the process is not quite so simple, since the pathway by which reaction occurs may involve higher energy intermediates.  It is the pathway of a reaction that determines its rate (how fast it occurs), while the difference between products and reactions determined the extent to which the reaction will occur.  However, to a good approximation, the approach we are going to look at to estimate energy changes during a reaction gives us a reasonable answer. <br />          <br />        As we have already seen, bond formation releases energy, bond breaking        requires energy. Tables of bond dissociation (breaking) energies are        found in most chemistry books and can be easily retrieved on the internet.        One caveat is that these measurements are typically taken in the gas        phase, and refer to a process where the bond is broken homolytically        (that is each atom in the original bond ends up with one electron and        the species formed are known as radicals. The bond dissociation energy        for hydrogen is the energy required to drive the process: H&ndash;H(g) -&gt; 2H&bull; <br />        <br />        where the dot represents an unpaired electron and &Delta;H = + 436 kJ/mol.<br />        <br />        Note that tables of bond energies record the energy required to break        the bond. Since enthalpy is a state function, meaning that its value        does not depend on the path taken for the change to occur, we also know        the enthalpy for the reverse process. That is: when a hydrogen molecule        forms from two hydrogen atoms the process is exothermic 2H &bull; &rarr; H&ndash;H(g)   &Delta;H        = &ndash; 436 kJ/mol.<br />        <br />          Since we have tables of bond energy values for most common bond types,              one way to figure out energy changes (or at least enthalpy changes)              for a particular reaction is to analyze the reaction in terms of              which bonds must be broken and which bonds are formed. The broken              bonds will contribute to a positive term to the total reaction              energy change while bond formation will contribute a negative term.              For example: let us take a closer look at the combustion of methane.<br />          CH<sub>4</sub>(g)+ 2O<sub>2</sub>(g)  &harr; CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p><p class="black">In the course of this reaction, four C-H bonds will be broken [4 x C&ndash;H (436kJ/mol)] and 2 x O=O (498 kJ/mol), while the new bonds formed are 2 x C=O (803 kJ/mol) and 4 x O&ndash;H (460 kJ/mol). If you do the math you find that the bond energies of all the bonds broken is 2740 kJ, while the sum of the bond energies formed is &ndash;3330 kJ. That is the bonds in the products are 706 kJ more stable than the bonds in the reactants. This may be easier to see if we plot the enthalpy vs reaction progress, it becomes more obvious that the products are lower in energy (more stable).</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><span class="black">There are several important aspects to note about this analysis.<br />      <br />1. This is only an estimation of the enthalpy change, since the bond energies are measured in the gas phase and are averages. In the real world most reactions don&rsquo;t occur in the gas phase. In solutions there are all kinds of other interactions (intermolecular forces) that can affect the enthalpy change, but for an initial approximation this method often gives surprisingly good results.</span></td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch7-15.jpg" width="280" height="220" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><span class="black">2. Remember, every reaction must be treated as a system. That is both the reactants and products have to be included in any analysis, and the direction of energy transfer between the reaction system and the surroundings. <br /><br />3.  An exothermic reaction occurs when the bonds formed are stronger than the bonds that are broken, and if we look closely at this calculation we can see a major reason why combustion reactions are so exothermic is that they produce carbon dioxide. The bond energy of the carbon-oxygen double bond is very high (although not two times the C&ndash;O single bond &ndash; canyou think why?). The production of CO<sub>2</sub> is very favorable from an energy standpoint,it sits in a deep energy well because it has such strong bonds. This point hasimportant ramifications for the world we live in. Carbon dioxide is quite stable(it can be made to react as we will see, but such reactions require the inputof energy).</span></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="508"><p class="black1"><span class="black"> There are large                    numbers of us expelling CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere (from burning                    fossil fuels &ndash; and breathing!), at a higher rate than                    it it is currently being removed (through various types of                    sequestration, chemical reactions and photosynthesis ).
