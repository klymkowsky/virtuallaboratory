The answer is, of course not, not if that book is just a variation on those currently available. Chemistry, and particularly introductory general chemistry, is simply not changing that much1 and people learn pretty much the same way they always did (at least if we restrict ourselves to the last few thousand years.)   On the other hand, there is compelling evidence that the way chemistry is commonly presented is both off-putting and ineffective, a potent combination that leads to the widespread misunderstanding of chemical principles. How many times do we hear about &quot;natural remedies, without drugs or chemicals&quot;?   The curious consumer might well ask themselves, &quot;well then, what is it composed of, exactly?&quot;</p></td>    <td width="16">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="180"><p class="black1"><img src="graphics/chapter-0.jpg" width="180" height="260" /><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p>A growing body of research results on student understanding of chemistry indicates, pretty emphatically, that we need better ways to teach and assess students&rsquo; understanding of  the fundamental ideas upon which chemistry is based. These are important ideas that students need to learn, and learn in a robust way that enables them to transfer their understanding to new situations (rather than just remember what they were told).  t would be even better if we could cultivate an appreciation for how science works, and in our most ambitious moments, light a spark of enthusiasm for the beauty, unity, and bizarre processes that make up the natural world. Our problem is how to approach the Socratic ideal in a practical and economically feasible manner. <br />      <br />    In this light, we should fess up to where we stand on a number of important issues &ndash; we unambiguously accept the liberal ideals of the enlightenment, namely that intellectual honesty and rigor, rational and logical discourse, and free and dispassionate analyses (together with compassion and empathy), are critical, both in the context of the scientific enterprise and more generally in making the world a better place for all of its inhabitants. Unfortunately, the ideals of the enlightenment appear to have fallen somewhat out of favor, at least in some circles. While there is an apparent excess of passion, few appear to be willing to examine objectively or even consider both the positive and negative implications of their positions. Passionate advocacy devoid of rational analysis and the recognition that our understanding of the world is tentative and incomplete, and likely to remain that way for some time into the future, seems to encourage various forms of irrational, and often cruel and violent beliefs,  many of which should be dismissed out of hand. </p>      <p>So, back to the project at hand &ndash; how do we build a better chemistry book and course?  We freely admit our inspirations. Books like Bill Bryson's &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; and Einstein and Infeld's &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot; present science in a logical and engaging manner, they are both interesting and stimulating to read - unfortunately, this is quite different from the style found in most textbooks. So what is missing from the Bryson and Einstein and Infeld books? Most obviously, they do not concern themselves with determining whether their readers really (accurately) understand, and can apply the ideas presented. Therein lies the logic and impetus behind our book, and the associated web-based and in-class materials. Our goal is the merge the inherently engaging aspects of chemistry with the active experiences and metacognitive reflection needed to rewire your brain so you really understand, and can use, chemical knowledge. </p>      <p>While there have been many &quot;educational experiments&quot; over the last 100 years, we take our inspiration from Socrates (470-399 BCE). Basically, our goal is to present concepts and skills in various ways, ask students to talk about and work with their understanding, and then ask questions about what they actually mean when they use specific words and ideas. Critical to the success of this approach is time. The time required to understand what students&rsquo; think before, during, and after reading the text and working with the applets and activities; the time required for students to recognize and talk about their assumptions; the time required to listen to them, to ask them what, exactly, they mean, and for them to explain, analyze, and where appropriate reconsider their ideas. Because of the critical link between time and learning, we will not consider some of the topics often presented in standard textbooks but will concentrate on more foundational ideas. Does this mean that using this book and its associated materials will leave you (the student) unprepared in critical areas of chemistry!  No, we think (and can demonstrate) not. Rather, it should leave you able to work through many of these topics on your own, and we will provide web resources to make this possible. </p>    <p>Much of the material in this new curriculum was developed using research on how people learn, and our own work on how to improve understanding and problem solving in college level science classes. In previous studies, we have found that our methods, which include dramatic reorganization, and reduction of materials &ldquo;covered&rdquo;, increase student interactions and activity and lead to equal (or better) performance on standardized exams, greater conceptual understanding, and improved problem solving skills.  By focusing the time and effort on the foundational ideas, we expect that you will achieve a more robust and confident understanding of chemical principles, an understanding that should serve you well in subsequent chemistry and other science courses, not to mention &ldquo;real life&rdquo;! </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black"><strong>Background</strong>: The chemical foundations of life, consciousness, love, hate, laughter and all that.</p>      <p class="black"><em>&quot;Since everything that happens in life is without exception chemistry (unless one wants to play with words and argue that chemistry is made up of different sciences), the only conclusion is that the appearance of life was the culmination of spontaneous chemistry becoming increasingly complex, ordered, and fast&quot;.&nbsp; &ndash; Clive Trotman (2004).

That said, this is not a &ldquo;chemistry for biologists&rdquo; (or non-scientists) book, but rather an approach to the difficult and often counterintuitive ideas at the heart of chemistry, from the perspective of an intelligent and engaged student who, often quite reasonably, finds these ideas unbelievable, arbitrary, or incoherent. Our goal is to assist you in developing a rigorous understanding of the foundations of chemistry, so that you can apply these ideas to a range of new situations. We are aware that many of you are not &ldquo;excited&rdquo; by the prospect of learning  chemistry, and we share your concerns &ndash; many of the ideas presented are difficult and counter-intuitive, and you may have been &ldquo;badly treated&rdquo; emotionally by past experiences with chemistry. At the same time, it is possible to approach chemistry from a more reasoned and rational direction, recognizing difficult ideas and why we are forced to accept them and how we can apply them. </p>    <p class="black"><strong>Why is basic chemistry often perceived as boring? </strong> </p>    <p class="black">One reason maybe the way it is all too commonly presented; a laundry list of facts to remember and exercises to perform, often with little effort to connect what are abstract and frankly weird concepts to your lifetime of day-to-day and quite real experiences. For example: it is certainly not obvious that matter is made of a small set of essentially indestructible types of atoms connected in various ways; or how such combinations of molecules can lead to complex processes like life and dreams. Where did this strange idea come from? How is it that we come to appreciate and accept the reality of something as abstract as atoms and molecules, or that a tree is composed primarily of gas (carbon dioxide) and water molecules, rearranged? Is it even possible for the average person to really accept, understand, and learn to work with such bizarre abstractions? Well we think we are reasonably average people, not withstanding our excessive amounts of formal education and our obsessive efforts to understand what may seem to be insignificant, weird and (occasionally) trivial problems. We think that while scientific understanding is not easy, it can be made more engaging by recognizing explicitly which ideas are odd, and what types of observations and logic led (or forced) scientists to accept them. Throughout our journey, we will consider what makes sense from our day to day experiences, how that differs from the current models of chemical systems, and what types of observations resolve the apparent contradictions between the two. We encourage you to take your own ideas seriously and consider when they do and do not make scientific sense. This is not an easy task, <span class="black">but it is the only way to understand scientific ideas, rather than simply memorizing words and formulae. </span></p>    <p class="black"><strong>Why think about chemistry from a biological perspective? </strong><br />      <br />      The answer is simple really, biological systems, whether cells, organisms, or ecosystems, are the most complicated examples of chemical systems. They rely on chemical reactions and the chemical properties of atoms and molecules to produce truly amazing behaviors. That said, they are something more because they are a special type of chemical system, they have a history. That is, they are the end products of evolutionary processes that have been going on for more than 3.5 billion years; these processes are based on random variations that are captured and turned into information through natural selection. <br />      Molecular analyses strongly support a rather amazing conclusion, namely that all organisms currently living on earth are related and descended from a common ancestor through unbroken lineages. This is only one of many amazing, bizarre, and counterintuitive ideas we will encounter. To help you grapple with these ideas we will use various web based interactive materials that will help you test and strengthen your understanding. If you feel like you are getting lost or overwhelmed, take a look at the map of concepts and key ideas (located on the inside covers of the book) &ndash; they serve as guides to where we are going and how we intend to get there. On another important note: we do not expect you to be tested on any of the material in this chapter &ndash; this section is intended to help orient you -  some instructors have trouble taking direction, so if yours&rsquo; attempts to test you on the materials in this chapter gently remind them not to. You are taking chemistry, not biology!</p>    <p class="black"><strong>Organisms as chemical systems</strong><br />      <br />      Living systems are chemical systems. So, what do we mean by a system?  Basically we mean anything we want to study. Systems are defined by boundaries that separate what is the system and what is not.  Some systems are open, with energy and matter entering and leaving them, others are closed - no energy or matter enters or leaves. The Laws of Thermodynamics (which we will revisit a number of times in the main part of the book) apply to all systems. <br />      <br />      To some extent all boundaries are arbitrary, and can be real or imaginary. That said, an obvious boundary with respect to life is the organism; it is the organism that grows and reproduces. But there are times when it is difficult to determine what is an organism. Consider lichens2, which appear to consist of multiple organisms (fungi and algae); are they one or multiple organisms? Or consider the roundworm Myrmeconema neotropicum, which infects the ant Cephalotes atratus; infection turns the ant&rsquo;s abdomen bright red and so enhances the chance that infected ants are eaten by birds; the bird's feces, in turn, are fed on by other ants, which then become infected3. Is the ant part of the roundworm?  It certainly is a essential part of the worm's reproductive system. You yourself4 can be considered a community of organisms that includes the bacterial cells that live in your gut5 and which can influence your health, in both beneficial and harmful ways. The same can be said of the fact that all biological organisms are composed of cells and the products of cells. There are situations, such as occurs during cancer, when cells stop &ldquo;playing by the rules&rdquo; and replicate to the detriment of the organism. Is a cancer a new organism or a defect in the original organism? One way to approach these ideas is to be very specific about defining the system that is being studied; this enables us to monitor the flow of energy and matter, and understand how the system interacts with its surroundings.</p>    <p class="black"><strong>Cells</strong><br />      <br />      A universal feature of organisms is that they are composed of discrete units, known as cells, which are recognized by the fact that they are bounded by a membrane, typically known as the plasma membrane.  One way of studying cells is to define the cell (rather than the organism) as the system under study.  It is within cells that the vast majority of chemical processes of life take place.6 The cell&rsquo;s membrane is composed of lipids and proteins (molecules we will consider in more detail later on); it separates the cell&rsquo;s interior from the non-living exterior (or surroundings). The structure of the membrane is determined by the thermodynamics of the interactions between lipids, proteins, and water - again a subject we will return to as we develop an understanding of how the structure and function of molecules are related to changes in energy and entropy and interactions with their environment. <br />      <br />      Whether it is composed of a single cell or many trillions of cells, a universal feature of organisms is that they are dynamic, a term used to imply that such systems are constantly changing and using energy. This is obvious when you play with your dog or cat, or walk around &ndash; clearly there is a difference between you and a stone. But dynamic means more than moving - it also means that living systems must capture energy and matter from their environment; the energy is used to transform and maintain matter in highly organized systems &ndash; cells, organisms, populations, societies and ecosystems. <br />      <br />      <strong>The origin of cells </strong><br />      <br />      The first cells/organisms arose more than 3.5 billion years ago. This was a unique time in the history of the earth, since before then there was no life (at least we do not have any evidence of it). One obvious question is: where did these first cells come from? We have two logical and distinct alternatives, either the first cells were formed naturally or they were formed through a supernatural process. However, science deals only with natural processes &ndash; that is: things we can measure objectively (if the supernatural were measurable it could be studied scientifically). In the absence of direct and scientific evidence to the contrary, as scientists, our working hypothesis is that the process by which cells were first formed was a natural one based upon physical and chemical processes. This idea was expressed by Charles Darwin (1809 &ndash; 1882), </p>    <p class="black"><em>&ldquo;It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were found.&quot; -   Letter to Joseph Hooker (1871)<br />    </em><br />That said, while there are a number of plausible hypotheses about how the first cells arose, no one (yet) has synthesized a living cell, although there is no reason to believe that this is impossible.  Why do we think that? One reason is that there is ample evidence that many different types of small biological molecules are easily formed under a wide range of conditions that are thought to mimic those found on the early pre-biotic (before life) Earth. Such molecules are commonly found in meteors, comets and interstellar dust clouds. However, the leap from chemical to biological systems, that is systems that can replicate and transmit information, has not yet been made in the laboratory.7 </p>    <p class="black">Since the late 1800s  it has been recognized that cells, and the organisms formed from them), are generated only by preexisting cells &ndash; this idea is known as the Cell Theory of Life. The cell theory has a number of profound implications, the first and foremost is that there has been an unbroken link between the cells that exist in the modern world and the first cells (however they arose). The structure of a new cell is not created anew, it is based on (inherited from) the mother cell's pre-existing structure.  Once that structure is disrupted life is lost and cannot be recaptured. <br />      <br />It is a strange idea that all organisms are composed of cells, and an even stranger idea that all cells share a very similar molecular organization &ndash; just as there seems to be no good reason that pandas and potatoes should both be composed of cells, there is even less reason to think that these cells should share common properties. Yet, many different types of evidence support the cell theory and it provides one of the foundational conceptual frameworks of modern biology. If we follow the logic of the cell theory, we might expect that a catalog of the traits shared by most modern cells would also be present  in their &ldquo;last common ancestor&rdquo;. For example, since all cells use molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to store genetic information and they store that information using the same &ldquo;language&rdquo;, we can be reasonably certain that their last common cellular ancestor also used this language and used DNA to store information.</p>    <p class="black"><strong>Cells, Organization, Entropy and Thermodynamics</strong><br />      <br />      Now you might ask yourself, don't the laws of thermodynamics have something to say here? Doesn't the universe tend to disorder? (the Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us it does, doesn&rsquo;t it?)  Isn&rsquo;t entropy (whatever that is) always increasing? and if that is true (and it should be, shouldn't it, since it is a law, after all), how, exactly, did living organisms get to be so highly organized in the first place? How could organized systems such as cells (to say nothing of humans) have formed from disorganized mixtures of chemicals? It seems likely that the origin of life must violate some law or is there some special &quot;living&quot; force at play, perhaps something supernatural? The answer is, no, there is no special living force &ndash; many experimental studies confirm that living organisms obey the laws of thermodynamics. The laws that govern the chemistry of living systems are no different from those that govern the chemical reactions that occurs in a glass reaction flask. &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; chemicals are no different than &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; or &ldquo;biological&rdquo; chemicals. <br />As is often the case in science, it is critical to be explicit about what we mean by specific words.  In this case the word is entropy. Entropy is a characteristic of a system (discussed in detail in chapter 5). We can think of entropy in terms of the amount of information required to specify a particular state of the system. For example, if we can devise a simple rule that accurately describes a system, such as &quot;the cards in the deck are in no special order&rdquo;, the entropy of the system is considered to be high because many different arrangements of cards, in fact every possible arrangement of cards, fulfills this rule. On the other hand, if the rule for defining the system is complex, such as  &quot;the cards are in the order Ace of hearts, followed by King, Queen, Jack, 10, etc., Ace of spades, followed by King, etc., Ace of clubs, etc., Ace of diamonds, etc.&quot;) then the entropy of the system is very low &ndash; in this case, there is one and only one arrangement that fulfills the rule. If we want a specific order (a low entropy system), we have to supply energy. We can sort the cards and arrange them in the order we want, a process that uses energy. This energy is used to keep ourselves alive and to power the mental and  coordinated muscle activity involved in arranging the cards into the order we want. Decreasing entropy requires energy, and the use of energy to do work leads to increasing entropy (that is the law!) <br />So at this point, your head might (should) be beginning to throb and it probably makes sense to make explicit the distinction between the entropy of the system and the entropy of the surroundings.   While it is common to think of cells as systems, they exist within larger systems  &ndash; energy (and matter) are entering and leaving the cell, going to and from the larger system of the organism, and from the organism to the ecosystem. A local increase in order (decreased entropy) within the cell, organism, or ecosystem must be more than balanced by an even greater increase in entropy in the greater system. That is: entropy of the system and surroundings always increases. In fact, living systems increase the rate at which the total entropy of the surroundings increases! This type of behavior, where a structure becomes more organized by increasing the entropy of the surroundings, also occurs in non-living systems, such as hurricanes and tornados8.&nbsp;No violation of the laws of thermodynamics occurs, or is required - living systems play by the same rules as non-living systems. </p><p class="black">&nbsp;</p>    <p class="black">&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions for ponder:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">What other natural processes look ordered to you? </li>        <li class="black">Does their order depend upon a constant import of energy?</li>        <li class="black">Where does that energy come from?

This ability to recover from trauma and adapt to their surrounding is a critical feature of living systems - they display both homeostatic and adaptive behaviors. What do we mean by homeostatic behavior? It is the ability to return to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (whatever that means) following a perturbation. It differs from the concept of chemical equilibrium in that it requires the input of energy - it is an active rather than a passive process.  Consider for example your response to changes in temperature - if your surroundings are too hot, you will begin to perspire, which leads to evaporative cooling. This process is mediated by groups of cells in your skin responding to signals generated from other cells that monitor temperature. Signals from these cells lead to the activation of sweat glands (groups of cells) in your skin, cellular contractions, and the release of water, all of which are active (energy-dependent, chemical) processes9. Similarly, a response to getting cold is to shiver, your muscle cells begin rapid cycles of contraction and relaxation, and because these processes are not 100% efficient (a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics), &ldquo;waste heat&rdquo; is generated. The shivering response uses chemical energy to produce heat.   Alternatively, you might put on (or remove) clothes in response to changes in temperature - while this is a different kind of response, it is still one that is actively regulated and uses energy. Somehow your brain, which is an interconnected network of cells, decides to move the muscles required to find and put on (or take off) clothes! &ndash; and yes, the functioning of your brain requires energy. </span></p>      <p class="black">Here is  an example of a combination of an adaptive and a homeostatic response. You are sitting quietly when you are startled by a loud and unexpected noise; your heart rate will probably go up &ndash;  this is an adaptive response, part of your built in &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; system. After a short while you (your brain) will recognize that there is no threat, and your system (that is, your heart rate) will return to its &quot;resting state&quot;. This is an example of homeostasis. On the other hand, suppose that you have been something of a &ldquo;couch potato&rdquo; and then decide to begin a serious exercise program. Again, your body will, over time, adapt. Your blood pressure and resting heart rate will, eventually, drop and your muscles will grow and strengthen in response to the mechanical forces applied to them; they adapt and eventually attain a  new homeostatic state. Both adaptation and homeostasis are active, energy requiring, non-equilibrium processes. </p>      <p class="black"><strong>The Cell as a Reaction Vessel</strong><br />        <br />Another difference between living and non-living systems is that the chemistry inside cells involve a relatively small numbers of particles; an average protein may be present anywhere from a few molecules to a few hundreds of thousands (~105) of copies. This is quite different from the (dramatically larger) numbers common to the chemistry you might already be familiar with (for example: 18 grams of water - a teaspoonful - contains 6.022 x 1023 water (H2O) molecules). Small numbers of molecules lead to random (stochastic) fluctuations that have to be dealt with if the system is to be stable, and living systems, while dynamic, are most assuredly stable, after all they have lasted more than 3.5 billion years. One explanation for biological complexity is the need to stabilize what are inherently noisy systems. Typically this is done through the use of various feedback and feedforward interactions. We will consider the details of such regulatory systems (really, networks of reactions), when we examine the mechanisms involved in chemical reactions, how they are regulated, and how they are coupled together within biological systems.</p>      <p class="black"><strong>Is life on Earth unique? </strong><br />        <br />A question with some philosophical import is &ldquo;are we alone in the universe?&rdquo;  People have been burned at the stake for holding the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; opinion about the answer to this question!  At present it remains unclear whether we should expect to find organisms on other planets, either within our solar system or in other solar systems and other galaxies. From a practical prospective, how would we detect the presence (or rather the possibility) of life at such great distances? If extraterrestrial life were like life on earth, it might manifest itself through the accumulation of molecular oxygen in a planet's atmosphere (since molecular oxygen is a major by-product of photosynthetic living systems here on Earth). A number of sensitive instruments, known as spectrometers, can detect the presence of specific molecules in interstellar space and in the atmosphere of other planets based on the way light is absorbed (we will talk about the atomic/molecular basis of light absorption and how it is used in chemistry in Chapter 2). These instruments are based on the assumption that the way atoms and molecules behave throughout the universe is exactly the same as they behave here on Earth. This assumption is rather tricky to prove, but like the rest of science, we can gain confidence as to its validity by testing predictions based on the assumption that it is true, and so far, this assumption appears to be valid. <br />If life is not unique to the earth, we can expect important and wide-ranging effects on various non-scientific belief systems &ndash; remember that Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was imprisoned by the Roman Catholic Inquisition for his support of the idea that the earth is not the center of the universe.  Similarly, if scientists are able to generate living organisms from non-living materials10, we might expect some serious philosophical and religious ramifications. When people argue that creating life in the laboratory is impossible, it is worth considering a quote from Charles Darwin. <br />&quot;Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science .&quot; - The Descent of Man (1871)</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions for ponder:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">Why would scientists not be terribly upset by the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe?</li>        <li class="black">Why might non-scientific belief systems be upset by such a discovery? </li>        <li class="black">Would it necessarily be a challenge to such systems?</li>      </ul>      <hr size="1" noshade /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black"><strong>Reproduction, Mutation and Randomness</strong><br />      <br />      Cells have an important property: they can reproduce, making new cells.

For a cell to reproduce, it must reproduce both types of information (this of course raises the interesting question, what is &ldquo;information&rdquo; exactly?)  So a very important and related question is, &ldquo;where does this information come from?&rdquo;  The answer involves the processes of evolution. When a cell reproduces itself, it makes of copy of the DNA molecules within it. While this process of DNA replication is usually accurate, changes (mutations) can, and do occur.  These mutations are largely random, they reflect noise in the system. If the effect of the mutation is harmful enough, the cell that receives it will not survive - that mutation will be lost. However, if the mutation has little effect, or more rarely, if it is beneficial to the organism, that is the mutation improves the organism&rsquo;s ability to survive and reproduce, it will be &ldquo;selected&rdquo;. It is the combination of mutation and selection that lead to the capture, or better yet creation, of new information. Depending upon the environment in which the organism lives and its lifestyle, the information within the individuals that survive will change. The effect of new mutations is dependent upon the information that has already accumulated within the organism. This phenomenon is where biological systems differ most dramatically from non-living systems - they have a history, they contain evolving information. </p>      <p class="black"><strong>Appreciating randomness: </strong><br />        <br />    Mutations appear at random, and it is difficult for us to accept that random events can be useful or creative. In fact, people appear to have a built in (evolved?) tendency to see patterns where there are none, phenomena known as apophena11 and pareidolia12 &ndash; this is why we often see recognizable shapes in clouds. Normally, when something happens most people seek an explanation or see a pattern. This is one of the reasons that conspiracy theorists can be so adamant in their beliefs; they refuse to accept that unrelated events are actually that, unrelated events &ndash; they prefer a meaningful explanation, often involving international conspiracies or supernatural interventions. In fact, given the rather large number of events that occur each day, it is not surprising that coincidences happen: there are pictures on burnt toast and suggestively shaped carrots. We project meaning and discount chance - this predilection can interfere with our understanding of how mutations act to generate novel solutions to the problems and opportunities faced by cells and organisms. Further on, we will consider in detail how the various types of mutation can produce creative and advantageous effects for the cells/organisms that contain them. </p>      <p class="black"><strong>Why does evolution happen? </strong><br />        <br />    If we think logically about reproduction of simple organisms, we quickly come to the same conclusion reached by Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), namely that biological systems are capable of generating astronomical numbers of off-spring in surprisingly short periods of time. Consider, the common bacterium Escherichia coli 13 (often called E. coli), a generally benign inhabitant of your colon. E. coli cells are small and cylindrically-shaped, on the order of 1 &mu;m (10-6 m) in diameter and 2 &mu;m in length.   Under optimal conditions, an E. coli cell can divide once every 20 minutes. If we start with one cell, 20 minutes later we have 2. Each of these cells will divide 20 minutes later, and so on. After 24 hours of unlimited growth, we would have 2350 m3 of E. coli cells, a volume much larger than that of the largest elephant or whale. Clearly, the growth of E. coli cannot continue unchecked for long, certainly not even for 24 hours. Under normal conditions resources are exhausted, cell growth slows, some cells die, and the number of surviving offspring a cell produces will be limited. When we examine a culture of E. coli that has reached this stage, we find that some cells have an ?advantage over others, that is, some cells and their offspring are more likely to survive under these starvation conditions than others &ndash; in fact they appear to be adapted to these conditions, living off the nutrients released when their neighbors die!14 Clearly not all E. coli cells are identical, or they would all die together.    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="600"><span class="black">Like all organisms, individual E. coli cells differ from one another.  Some of these differences are due to chance15, but others are due to genetics - they can be inherited in a stable manner.  When we look at the molecular level, we find that these inherited differences are due to mutations in the information held in the cell&rsquo;s DNA molecules. The ways that mutations change cell behavior can be complex and not really important to us (particularly in a chemistry course), beyond the fact that they are passed on to cell&rsquo;s/organism&rsquo;s offspring. Some mutations are incompatible with life, and the cells/organisms that contain them disappear from the population; others have little or no effect, and yet others can improve the cell&rsquo;s ability to survive and reproduce. In the case of a culture of starving E. coli cells, mutations that let a cell survive longer than its neighbors provides an advantage, the survivor can feed off its dead neighbors. </span></td>    <td width="11">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="129"><img src="graphics/ch0-1.jpg" width="129" height="234" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><span class="black">As first stated clearly by Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and Alfred Wallace (1823-1913), the ability to produce many offspring and the inheritable variation between individuals will inevitably alter the relative reproductive success of organisms and lead to changes in the population over time. Because of the rapid growth rates of E. coli cells, the dynamics of this process can be studied directly in the lab16  and it is now possible to map which mutations occur in which lineage and begin to understand how these mutations provide a selective advantage17. While we have been considering bacteria, the same is true of all organisms - evolutionary change is unavoidable. </span></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions for ponder:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">Would we be better off if we used a different, more stable molecule to store our genetic information, a molecule that was more stable or wasn't as easily damaged or prone to replication errors as DNA? </li>        <li class="black">Would evolution occur without mutation? </li>      </ul>      <hr size="1" noshade /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p><strong>The origin of species: </strong></p>      <p>The evolutionary process takes place on Earth, where environments change over time. As environments change, which mutation-based adaptations are beneficial and which are detrimental can also change. Certain populations will succeed, others will disappear (become extinct). Sometimes populations will become distinct, due to geographical, behavioral, or other reasons. With time, one type of organism (a species), can become two. This process, carried out over long periods of time (tens of thousands to millions of years) gives rise to distinct species, which in turn can give rise to other species. This branching process, over time, has produced an amazing array of species; current estimates suggest that there are many millions of distinct species currently alive, and many more that have lived, but are now extinct). Some of these organisms are remarkably specialized in their adaptations. Consider, for example Dicyemid japonicaum 18, an apparently simple multicellular animal found only in the renal sacks (the equivalent of your kidneys) of squids and octopi (cephalopods: from the Latin words for head and foot). Some organisms are found widely, others only in very specific places. The process of evolution explains this biological diversity in a natural, predictive and self-consistent way. <br />        <br />    The fossil record illustrates this biological diversity - different types of organisms are found to have lived at different times in the past. Based on the fossil record, we can map out the history of life on earth. Between the origins of life, approximately 3800 x 106 years ago , and for about 1500 x 106 years thereafter, there were only microscopic forms of life. Beginning around ~ 600 x 106 year ago we begin to find evidence for larger, multicellular organisms. This was followed by a progression of different types of organisms; for example, fish appeared around 500 x 106 years ago, amphibians around 400 x 106 years ago, reptiles around 320 x 106 years ago, mammals (or rather mammal-like reptiles, known as synapsids) around 220 x 106 years ago, and birds around 170 x 106 years ago. Dinosaurs, which were reptiles and were related to birds and crocodiles (together these are know as Archosaurs)19, became extinct around 65 x 106 years ago while our ancestral lineage, the primates, first appeared ~85 x 106 years ago20. The first modern humans (Homo sapiens) appeared between 0.4 to 0.13 x 106 (400,000 to 130,000) years ago. To give these numbers some context, the first of the major pyramids of Egypt, that of Djozer, was built 0.00046 x 106 (4600) years ago (between 2630 and 2612 BCE) and the United States gained independence from England some 0.00025 x 106 years ago. You were probably born about 0.00002 x 106 years ago.</p>    <p>Given the cell theory and the evidence for a common ancestor of all organisms, it is not surprising that, even though the fossil record is incomplete (fossilization is a very iffy proposition, very few organisms are fossilized and very few fossils are discovered before they are destroyed by erosion - because of their lifestyles and where they lived, some organisms fossilize well, others rarely if at all).  Nevertheless, there are a number of &quot;transition&quot; fossils, with more being discovered every year. For example, there are clear examples of intermediates between fish and amphibians, between amphibians and reptiles, between reptiles and mammals, between reptiles and birds21, and between early primates and the various modern day primates, including humans. The changes in organisms during the history of life, as well as the presence of transitional fossils is what is known as the fact of evolution, namely that life in the past was not the same as life today. Any scientific theory of life therefore has to explain three major observations, the fact of evolution, the diversity of life, and its common features and details.   The theory of evolution does just that. </p>    <p><strong>Human evolution: </strong></p>    <p>Since its first appearance, the human population has continued to evolve. For example, recent genetic analyses indicate that the pale skin color of Northern Europeans arose approximately 6000 to 8000 years ago, some 30,000 years after their ancestors migrated into Europe from Africa22. This appears to have been an evolutionary adaptation that arose in response to the need for vitamin D, which is normally obtained from the diet or produced through a UV-light-driven chemical reaction that transforms a derivative of cholesterol (7-?dehydrocholesterol) into the precursor of vitamin D (pre-vitamin D3) in the skin. Vitamin D is required for a number of functions, and its absence leads to serious diseases, such as rickets23.  At higher latitudes, pigments that were beneficial in Africa (because they absorb UV light and protect the skin from the damaging effects of the sun) blocked the ability to produce sufficient vitamin D. Mutations that altered the ability to produce these pigments led to an increase in the skin&rsquo;s ability to generate vitamin D. The model is that that such mutations would be advantageous for people living at higher latitudes, while disadvantageous in populations living more equatorially, since they would be associated with higher rates of skin cancer. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="603" class="black">Similarly, most adult mammals have lost the ability to digest milk, and specifically the milk sugar lactose (even though all mammals can digest lactose as infants).
