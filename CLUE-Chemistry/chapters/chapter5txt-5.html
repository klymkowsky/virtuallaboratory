The First Law of Thermodynamics tells            us that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but it can be            transferred from a system to its surroundings and vice versa. For            any system, if we add up the kinetic and potential energies of all            of the particles that make up the substance we get the total energy &ndash; this            is called the system&rsquo;s internal energy, E. It turns out that            it is not really possible to measure the total internal energy of            a system - but what can be measured and calculated is the change            in internal energy &Delta;E (the Greek letter &Delta; stands for &ldquo;change            in&rdquo;). There are two ways that the internal energy of a system            can change - we can change the total amount of thermal energy in            the system (denoted &ldquo;q&rdquo;) or the system can do work, or            have work done to it (work is denoted &ldquo;w&rdquo;).

On the other hand, work (usually defined as force            x distance) done on or by the system is a macroscopic phenomenon.            If the system occupies more or less volume, work is done on the surroundings            or on the system, respectively. Imagine pushing the plunger of a            syringe to expel a liquid - that process involves work (and it can            be carried out under conditions where temperature does not change).            That said, most systems we study in chemistry do not expand or contract            significantly (except gases. In these situations  &Delta;E = q, the thermal energy (heat) change.  In addition most of the systems we will study in chemistry (and biology) are under constant pressure (usually atmospheric pressure).  It turns out that the heat change at constant pressure is what is known as a &ldquo;state function&rdquo; and is called enthalpy (H). In a system at constant pressure with no volume change, it is the change in enthalpy (&Delta;H)            that we will be primarily interested in (together with the change            in entropy - see below).</p><p class="black">Since we cannot measure energy changes directly, we have to use some observable (and measurable) change in the system. Typically we measure the temperature change and then relate it to the energy change. For changes that occur at constant pressure and volume this energy change is the enthalpy change &Delta;H. If we know the temperature change (&Delta;T), the amount (mass) of material and its specific heat, we can calculate the enthalpy change (J) = mass (g) x specific heat (J/ g &ordm;C)  x &Delta;T (&ordm;C).  When considering the enthalpy change for a process, the direction of energy transfer is important. By convention if thermal energy goes out of the system to the surroundings (that is, the surroundings increase in temperature) the sign of &Delta;H is negative and we say the process is exothermic (literally heat out). Combustion reactions, such as burning wood or gasoline, are probably the most common examples of exothermic processes.  In contrast if a process requires thermal energy from the surroundings to make it happen, that is: energy is transferred from the surroundings to the system, the sign of &Delta;H is positive and we say the process is endothermic.</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">You have systems (at 10&ordm;C) composed of water, methanol, ethanol or propanol.</li>        <li class="black"> Predict the final temperature of each system if equal amounts of thermal energy (q) are added to equal amounts of a substance (m).  </li>        <li class="black">What do you need to know to do this calculation? <br />        </li>        <li class="black">Draw a simple sketch of a system and surroundings.

This idea is captured by the phrase, for any change in a system, the total entropy of the <strong>universe</strong> must increase. As we will see, this means that some of the energy is changed into a form that can no longer do work. <br />        <br />    There are lots of subtle and not so subtle implications captured in these            statements and we will need to look at them carefully to identify            them. You already probably have ideas about what entropy means, but            what does it mean scientifically? As you might imagine, it is not            a simple idea. As you may know the word entropy is often used to            designate randomness or disorder, but this is not a very useful or            accurate way to define entropy (although randomly disordered systems            do have high entropy). A better way to think about it - a way that            will allow us to measure, calculate and predict outcomes, is to think            about entropy in terms of probabilities. As we will see, thermal            energy transfers from hot to cold systems because the outcome is            the most probable outcome. A drop of dye disperses in water because            the resulting dispersed distribution of dye molecules is the most            probable. Osmosis occurs when water passes through a membrane from            a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution, because the            resulting system is more probable. In fact whenever a change occurs,            the overall entropy of the Universe always increases. The Second            Law has (as far as we know) never, ever been found to have been violated.            In fact the direction of entropy change has been called &ldquo;time&rsquo;s arrow&rdquo; - the forward direction of time is determined by the entropy change.  At this point you should be shaking your head - all this can&rsquo;t            possibly be true. First: if entropy is always increasing then in            the past was there a time when entropy was 0? [<a href="http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/041118/entropy.shtml" target="_blank">link</a>]. Second, you can            probably think of situations where entropy decreases (things become            more ordered), for example when you clean up a room. FInally, while            it is commonsense that time flows in only one direction (to the future),            it is also the case that at the atomic and molecular scale all events            are reversible - how does that work? </p><p class="black"><strong>Probability and Entropy</strong></p>      <p class="black">Before we look at entropy in detail, let us remind ourselves about probability. Let us look at a few systems and think about what is more probable. For example: if you take a deck of cards and shuffle it, which is more probable - that the cards will shuffle into the order ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9 &hellip; etc for each suite - or that they will end up in some random jumbled order? Of course the answer is obvious: the random order is much more probable since there are many sequences of cards that &ldquo;count&rdquo; as random order, but only one that is &ldquo;ordered&rdquo;.  This is true even though whatever order the shuffled cards actually assume is, itself, just as unlikely as the perfectly ordered one. But because we &ldquo;care&rdquo; about a particular order, we place all other possible orders of the cards together - we do not distinguish between them. </p>      <p class="black">We can calculate, mathematically, the probability of the result we care about. To determine the probability of an event (for example, a particular order of cards), we divide the number of outcomes cared about by the total number of possible outcomes. For 52 cards there are 52! (factorial)(52 x 51 x 50 x 49 &hellip;.) ways that the cards can be arranged [<a href="http://www.schuhmacher.at/weblog/52cards.html" target="_blank">link</a>]; this number is approximately 8.07 x 1067, a number on the same order of magnitude as the number of atoms in our galaxy.  So the probability of shuffling cards to produce any one particular order is 1/52! - a very small number indeed (but since it is &gt; 0, this is an event that can happen, and in fact it always happens, since the probability that some arrangement of cards will be occur is 1 - now that is a mind bender, but true nevertheless, highly improbable events occur all the time! [<a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2009/09/11" target="_blank">link</a>]<br />        <br />This idea of entropy in terms of probabilities can help us understand why different substances or systems have different entropies. We can actually calculate entropies for  many systems from the formula S = klnW, where S is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and W is the number of distinguishable arrangements (or states) that the system has. So the larger the value of W (the number of arrangements) the larger the entropy. <br /><br />      In some cases it is relatively easy to figure out which system will have more arrangements. For example, in a solid substance (for example, ice) the molecules are fixed in place and can only vibrate. While in a liquid the molecules are free to roam around. So that each molecule has the possibility that it could be anywhere within the liquid mass (not confined to one position). In a gas the molecules are not confined at all, and can be found anywhere (or at least anywhere in the container). In general gases have more entropy than liquids and solids. This so - called positional entropy can be extended to mixtures. In most (but not all - as we will see) mixtures the number of distinguishable arrangements is larger for the mixture, than for the unmixed components. The entropy of a mixture is larger (usually).</p>      <p class="black">So let us return to the idea that the direction of change in a system is determined by probabilities. We will consider the transfer of thermal energy (heat) and see if we can make sense of it. FIrst, remember that energy is quantized. So, for any substance at a particular temperature there will be a certain number of energy quanta. To make things simple(r) we will consider a four atom solid that contains 2 quanta of energy. These quanta can be distributed so that a particular atom can have 0, 1, or 2 quanta of energy. You can now either calculate (or determine by trial and error) the number of different possible arrangements of these quanta (there are 10). Remember that  W is the number of distinguishable arrangements, so for this system W = 10 and S = k ln 10. Now what happens if we consider two similar systems, one with 4 quanta and the other with 8 quanta. The system with 4 quanta will be at a lower temperature than the system with 8 quanta. We can also calculate the value of W for the 4 quanta (4 atom) system by considering the maximum number of possible ways to arrange the quanta over the 4 atoms.  For the 4 atom 4 quanta system W = 35.  If we do the same calculation for the 8 quanta 4 atom system W = 165. If taken together, the total number of arrangements of the two systems considered together is 35 x 165  = 5775. <br />But what about temperature?</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="468"><p class="black">The 4 quanta system is at a lower temperature than the 8 quanta system, since the 8 quanta system has more energy.  What happens if we put the two systems in contact? Energy will transfer from the hotter (8) to the colder (4) system until the temperatures are equal. At this point, each will have 6 quanta (which corresponds to a W of 84); since there are two systems (each with 6 quanta), the total W for the combined systems is W of 84 x 84 = 7056 states. You will note that 7056 is greater than 5775. [We multiply, rather than add W when we combine systems.] <br />      <br />    </p></td>    <td width="12">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="220"><p class="black1"><img src="graphics/ch5-6.jpg" width="363" height="293" /><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black">Our conclusion, there are more distinguishable arrangements in the two systems after the energy transfer than before - the final system is more probable and so has a higher entropy.</p>    <p class="black">Now you might well object - given that we are working with systems of only 4 or 5 atoms each, it is easy to imagine that random fluctuations could lead to the movement of quanta from cold to hot, and that is true - that is why the behavior at the nanoscale is reversible.

Remember a very small drop of water, weight 0.05 grams, contains approximately 1.8 x 10<sup>21</sup> molecules (perhaps you can also calculate the volume of such a drop). What is reversible at the nanoscale is irreversible at the macroscopic scale &ndash; yet        another wacky and (perhaps) counter-intuitive fact.
