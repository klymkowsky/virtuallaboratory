To understand how these types of reactions are related, we need to learn how to identify their essential and common components. Our first hurdle is the fact that the terms acid and acidity (and to a lesser extent, bases and basicity) have entered the language of everyday life.  Most people have some notion of acids and acidity. Examples of common usage include: acid rain, stomach acid, acid reflux, acid tongue, etc. You might hear someone talk about wine that tastes acidic, by which (we think) they mean sour &ndash; and most people would understand that the wine tastes like vinegar (which contains acetic acid). You have also probably heard or even learned about measurements of acidity that involve &ldquo;pH&rdquo;, but what is pH exactly?  What is an acid, and why would you want to &ldquo;neutralize&rdquo; it?  Are acidic things &ldquo;bad&rdquo;?  Do we need to avoid them at all costs and under all circumstances? While the term &ldquo;base&rdquo; is less common, you are likely to be  familiar with materials that are basic in the chemical sense (not in the normal language sense of being fundamental). Bases are often called alkalis &ndash; as in alkaline batteries or alkali metals, they are slippery to the touch and bitter tasting.<br />          <br />          The idea of acids and bases is complex and appears on the surface to          involve a number of different types of reactions. Not surprisingly,          then a number of definitions of acid-base reactions have been developed          and used over the years &ndash; but not to worry, each definition turns          out to be consistent with the others &ndash; they represent the evolution          of an idea. Subsequent definitions encompass the original ideas about          acid-base while widening them; making them more broadly applicable,          that is, they cover a larger array of reactions with similar characteristics.          We will start with the simplest model of acids and bases &ndash; the          Arrhenius model because it is the most common introduction to acid-base          chemistry (perhaps you will remember being taught this way). However,          the Arrhenius model of acids and bases is actually of limited usefulness.          Once we have introduced it, we will proceed to more sophisticated,          and more generally useful, models. Our model-by-model consideration          of acid-base models should help you appreciate how our understanding          of acid-base chemistry has become increasingly general, precise and          powerful over time. At the same time, it might help to keep this simple          rule in mind; that all acid-base reactions begin and end with polarized          molecules. As we go through the descriptions of various models for          acid-base reactions, see if you can identify the polar groups, and          how they interact with each other during the reaction. </p>          <p class="black"><strong>Arrhenius acids and bases:</strong></p>          <p class="black">In the Arrhenius model an acid is a compound that,              when dissolved in water, dissociates at the molecular level to              produce a proton (H+) and a negatively charged ion (an anion).              In fact, naked protons (H+) do not roam around in solution &ndash; they              are always associated with at least one, and more likely multiple              water molecules. Generally, chemists use a shorthand for this              situation, either referring to the H+ in aqueous solution as a              hydronium ion (denoted as H<sub>3</sub>O+) or even more simply as H+ , but              do not forget, this is a short-hand, H+ stands for aqueous H+ or            H+(aq).</p>          <p class="black"> An example of an Arrhenius acid reaction is: HCl(g)              + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; H<sub>3</sub>O+ (aq) + Cl&ndash;(aq), <br />          or <br />          more simply (and more true to the original theory): HCl(g) &harr; H+ (aq)          + Cl&ndash;(aq)  or HCl(aq). </p>          <p class="black">But this is really quite a weird way to present the actual situation, since the HCl molecule does not interact with a single water molecule, but rather interacts with water as a solvent.   When hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas is dissolved in water, it dissociates into H+ (aq) and Cl&ndash; (aq) almost completely.  For all intents and purposes there are no HCl molecules in the solution.  An aqueous solution of HCl is known as hydrochloric acid, which distinguishes it from the gas hydrogen chloride. This complete dissociation is a characteristic of what are known as strong acids (but not all acids are strong acids!) <br />              <br />          An Arrhenius base is a compound that, when dissolved in water, generates hydroxide (&ndash;OH) ions. The most common examples of Arrhenius bases are the Group I (alkali metal) hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide: <br />          NaOH(s) + H2O &harr; Na+(aq) + &ndash;OH(aq)  or NaOH(aq). <br />          <br />          Again, this is a reaction system that involves both NaOH and liquid water. The process of forming a solution of sodium hydroxide is just like that involved in the interaction between sodium chloride (NaCl) and water, in that the ions (Na+ and &ndash;OH) separate and are solvated by the water. <br />          <br />          As we will see shortly, some acids (and bases) do not ionize completely,          that is when they dissolve in water some of the acid molecules remain          intact. When this occurs we use double headed arrows (&harr;) to indicate          that the reaction is reversible, and both reactants and products are          present in the same reaction mixture. We will have much more to say          about which direction (and how far) a reaction proceeds in the next          chapter. For now, it is enough to understand that acid-base reactions          (and in fact all reactions) are reversible at the molecular level.          In the case of these simple Arrhenius acids and bases, however, the          reaction proceeds almost exclusively to the right.</p>          <p class="black"> An Arrhenius acid-base reaction occurs when a dissolved (aqueous) acid and a dissolved (aqueous) base are mixed together.  The product of such a reaction is usually said to be a salt plus water and the reaction is often called a neutralization reaction; the acid &ldquo;neutralizes&rdquo; the base, and vice versa.  The equation may be written like this: <br />         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O(l)         + NaCl(aq)<br />          <br />              When the reaction is written in this &ldquo;molecular&rdquo; form              it is quite difficult to see what is actually happening. If we              rewrite the equation to show all of the species involved, and assume              that the number of HCl and NaOH molecules are equal, we get: <br />             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H+ (aq) +             Cl&ndash; (aq)             + Na+ (aq) + &ndash;OH             (aq) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O(l)             + Na+ (aq) + Cl&ndash; (aq)<br />              <br />              Na+ (aq) and Cl&ndash; (aq) appear on both sides of the equation,              that is, they are unchanged and do not react. The only actual reaction              that occurs, is the formation of water&nbsp; <br />            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; H+ (aq)   + &ndash;OH              (aq) &harr; H<sub>2</sub>O(l)<br />            <br />              The formation of water (not the formation of a salt) is the &ldquo;signature&rdquo; of an Arrhenius acid - base reaction. A number of common &ldquo;strong&rdquo; acids,              including hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and nitric              acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) will, when reacted with a strong base (which, like              strong acids, dissociate completely in water) such as NaOH or KOH,              produce a similar reaction - they produce water. <br />              <br />              Such acid-base reactions are always exothermic, and we can measure              the temperature change and calculate the corresponding enthalpy              change (&Delta;H) for the reaction. It turns out that it does not              matter which strong acid or strong base you choose, the enthalpy              change is always the same (about 58kJ/mol of H2O produced). This              is because the same and only net reaction that takes place in a              solution of a strong acid and strong base is: <br />             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H+ (aq)  + &ndash;OH (aq) &harr;             H<sub>2</sub>O(l). <br />              <br />              One other factor to note is that the overall reaction involves              a new bond being formed between the proton (H+) and the oxygen              of the hydroxide (&ndash;OH). It makes sense that something with a positive charge should be attracted (and bond with) a negatively charged species (although you should recall why the Na+ and Cl&ndash; do              not combine to form sodium chloride solid in aqueous solution).              Whether such a reaction occurs (bond formation or not bond formation)              depends on the exact nature of the system, and the enthalpy and              entropy changes that are associated with the change. <br />              <br />              We will return        to this idea later.</p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">What would be the reaction if equal amounts if equimolar HNO<sub>3</sub> and KOH were mixed?</li>        <li class="black">How about equal amounts if equimolar H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and KOH?(What            would the products be?)</li>        <li class="black">How about equal amounts if equimolar H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and KOH?</li>        <li class="black">How many moles of NaOH would be needed to react fully            with one mole of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>?</li>      </ul>      <hr size="1" noshade /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr>        <td><p class="black"><strong>Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry Acids and Bases.</strong></p>          <p class="black"> While the Arrhenius acid-base model is fairly easy to understand, it is very restrictive in terms of the kinds of reactions to which it applies. So rather than continuing down this road, chemists found that they needed to expand their model of acids and bases and how they react. The first of these expansions was the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry model. In the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry model, an acid is characterized as a proton (H+) donor and a base as a proton acceptor. If we revisit the reactions we looked at earlier, but now in terms of the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acid-base model we see that HCl is the proton donor, it gives away H+ and water is the proton acceptor.  In this scheme, HCl is the acid and water is the base.</p>          <p class="black"> HCl(g) + 	H<sub>2</sub>O(l) 		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &harr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	H<sub>3</sub>O+              (aq) + Cl&ndash;(aq)<br />          Acid	    &nbsp;&nbsp;	+ Base		        conjugate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acid          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + conjugate          base</p>          <p class="black">The resulting species are called the conjugate acid (so H<sub>3</sub>O+ is the conjugate acid of H<sub>2</sub>O), and the conjugate base (Cl&ndash; is the conjugate base of HCl). This is because H<sub>3</sub>O+ could (and generally does) donate its H+ to another molecule, most often another water molecule, while Cl&ndash;  can accept an H+. </p>          <p class="black"> A major (and important difference) between the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry and Arrhenius acid base models is that a Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acid must always have an accompanying base to react with - the two are inseparable. A proton donor has to have something to donate the protons to (a base), and in this case it is water. Remember that bond breaking always requires energy, while bond formation always releases energy.  A reaction in which the only thing that happens is the breaking of a bond (for example the Cl&ndash;H bond in HCl) will always requires the input of energy.  Acid-base reactions are typically exothermic; they release energy to the surroundings) and that released energy is associated with the interaction between the H+ and the base. That is the proton does not drop off the acid and then bond with the base, instead the acid&ndash;H bond starts to break as the base&ndash;H bond starts to form. One way that we can visualize this process is to draw out the Lewis structures of the molecules involved and see how this proton is transferred.<br />            <br />        In this representation we use a dotted line to show the growing attraction        between the partial positive charge on the H of the H-Cl molecule and        the partial negative charge on the oxygen. This interaction results in        the destabilization of the H-Cl bond. Because the Cl is more electronegative        than the H, the electrons of the original H-Cl bond remain with the Cl        (which becomes Cl-), while H+ forms a new bond with a water molecule. </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td width="500"><span class="black">Essentially a Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acid base reaction involves the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base, while leaving the original bonding electrons behind.</span></td>    <td width="240"><img src="graphics/ch7-1.jpg" width="292" height="66" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr>        <td class="black"><p><br />            Another example of an acid-base reaction is the reaction of ammonia with water.<br />          NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &harr; 	NH<sub>4</sub>+(aq)          + 	&ndash;OH(aq)<br />          Base	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acid	               conjugate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acid&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +           conjugate base<br />          <br />          In this case, oxygen is more electronegative than the nitrogen.  The          proton is transferred from the oxygen to the nitrogen, and again the          dotted line represents the developing bond between the hydrogen and          the nitrogen. As the H-O bond breaks, a new H-N bond forms, making          the resulting NH<sub>4</sub>+ molecule positively charged. The electrons          associated with the original H-O bond are retained by the O, making          it negatively charged. So water is the acid and the ammonia is the          base! An important difference between this and the preceding HCl &ndash; H<sub>2</sub>O          reaction is that H<sub>2</sub>O is a much weaker acid than is HCl.          In aqueous solution not all of the NH<sub>3</sub> reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O          to form NH<sub>4</sub>+.  Moreover, the reaction between NH<sub>3</sub> and          water is reversible, as indicated by the &harr; symbol. Can you draw the          reaction for the reverse process? Again, the next chapter will consider          the extent to which a reaction proceeds to completion. <br />          <br />          You might ask why, in the reaction with NH<sub>3</sub>, does the water not act as a base (like it does with HCl). If you draw out the products resulting from a proton transfer from nitrogen to oxygen, you will see that this process results in a mixture of products where the more electronegative atom (O) now has a positive charge, and the less electronegative atom (N) has a negative charge. Now that does not seem right, does it (assuming that electronegativity means affinity for electrons)? We would predict that this situation is extremely unlikely. <br />          <br />    </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>        <td width="400" class="black">We will return to a discussion of what makes a compound acidic and/or basic shortly.

For example methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)                    and other hydrocarbons are not acidic; they do not donate                    protons to other molecules. When acids are written in their                    normal form it can be very difficult to see any similarities,                    but if we draw out the Lewis structures some commonalities                    emerge.<br />          <br />          One common feature of an acid is that the proton that gets donated (or picked off) is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, most generally an oxygen or a halogen (Cl, Br, I). So, once you know what to look for it is quite easy to spot the potentially acidic sites in a molecule - for example, in the figure above, you could circle the &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; Hs. This a useful skill (the ability to spot donate-able Hs) that allows you to predict properties of more complex molecules. But what exactly are the reasons why a hydrogen covalently bonded to an oxygen (or a halogen) is potentially acidic (donate-able)?<br />          <br />          First, let us consider the O-H bond. Based on our discussion of water molecules, we predict that it will be polarized, with a partial positive charge on the H and as partial negative on the O. In water, the H is (on average) also part of a hydrogen bond (intermolecular interaction) to the oxygen of another water molecule. It turns out that it does not take much energy to break the original O&ndash;H bond.   Remember the H+ does not just drop off the acid, but forms a bond with the base molecule. In fact strong acid-base reactions are typically exothermic, meaning that the new bond formed between the proton (H+) and the base is stronger than the bond that was broken to release the H+. The released energy raises the temperature of the surroundings. In an aqueous solution of a strong acid, hydrogens ions are moving rapidly and randomly from one oxygen to another; the energy for all this bond breaking coming from the thermal motion of water molecules. <br />          <br />          We also have to consider what happens to the oxygen that gets left behind. When the acidic hydrogen is transferred, it leaves behind the electrons that were in the bond, giving that atom more electrons than it started with. The species left behind must be stable even with those extra electrons (the negative charge). In the example below, chloride ion Cl&ndash;(aq) is &ldquo;left&rdquo; when the proton gets transferred away. We know chloride is stable, and common. It is not surprising to find it as one of the products of the reaction. <br />          HCl(g)  +    H<sub>2</sub>O(l) 	&harr; 	H<sub>3</sub>O+ (aq)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;	+          Cl&ndash;(aq)<br />          Acid	       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base	     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conjugate          acid + conjugate base</p><p class="black">Now let us recall that the definition of electronegativity is a measure of the ability to attract (and retain) electrons. It therefore makes sense that a negatively-charged electronegative atom, like chlorine or oxygen, will be more stable than a negatively-charged, but less electronegative atom, such as carbon. </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li><span class="black">What other atoms besides chlorine or oxygen would be electronegative enough to stabilize those extra electrons?</span></li>        <li><span class="black">Draw out the reactions of each of the strong                acids with water.

The words we use to describe solutions of acids and bases fall into these categories and are easily mixed up. We use the term strong to refer to those acids that ionize completely in water, and weak acids for those that are only partially ionized (see chapter 8 for more information on why). That is, strong and weak are used to describe an intrinsic property of the acid (or base). The terms dilute and concentrated are used to describe the concentration of the acid in water. So we could have a dilute solution (say 0.1 M) of the strong acid hydrochloric acid, or a concentrated solution (say 10 M) of the weak acid acetic acid. In contrast, in everyday life we tend to use the terms strong and weak to describe the concentration of solutions, for example if you say &ldquo;this tea is very weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;I like my coffee strong&rdquo; - what you are really saying is that you like a lot of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; dissolved in the solution you are drinking. It is important to remember this difference, and understand that the context in which words are used can often change their meaning.</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">Draw out molecular level pictures of a dilute solution of a strong acid, and a weak acid.</li>        <li class="black">Draw out molecular level pictures of a concentrated            solution of a strong acid, and a weak acid.</li>        <li class="black">What are the similarities and differences between all            the representations you have drawn?</li>        <li class="black">If you need to dilute a concentrated solution of a            strong acid with water, considering your knowledge of the energy            changes associated with the reaction of an strong acid with water.</li>        <li class="black">Which            makes more sense (from a safety point of view): should you -                <ul>                    <li>Add water slowly (dropwise) to the concentrated, strong acid,                        or</li>                    <li>Add the concentrated strong acid dropwise to water?

As we have already seen, the ability of the conjugate base to holdon (stabilize) the electron pair is crucial. There are several ways this is accomplished.The simplest is that the acidic H is attached to an electronegative atom suchas O, N or a halogen. However there is a wide range of acidities for &ldquo;oxyacids&rdquo; (in particular), and most of these differences are due to the numberof places that the extra electron density can be stabilized. </td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch7-4.jpg" width="328" height="270" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td><span class="black">A fairly simple example is the difference between                ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH).                Acetic acid is about 10 billion (10<sup>10</sup>) times more                acidic than ethanol, the reason is being the conjugate base (acetate)                is able to stabilize the negative charge to be stabilized on                TWO oxygens instead of one.</span><br /></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black"><strong>How to spot a base</strong></p>    <p class="black"> There is an equally simple method to figure out which compounds        are potential bases. Let us take a look at some common bases. The first        bases that most people encounter are the metal hydroxides such as NaOH,        KOH, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> etc. The metal ions, generated when these compounds dissolve        in water, typically do not play any role in acid base reactions. The        base in these compounds is the hydroxide (&ndash;OH).  Another common        class of bases are molecules, like NH<sub>3</sub>, that contain nitrogen. There        many kinds of such &ldquo;nitrogenous bases&rdquo;  some        of which play an critical role in biological systems. </p></td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch7-5.jpg" width="196" height="217" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p>For example, the &ldquo;bases&rdquo; in nucleic acids (DNA        and RNA) are basic because they contain nitrogen. Let us not forget that        water is also basic, and can accept a proton.&nbsp; </p>        <p>So what is the common            structural feature in bases? Well, if an acid is the species with            a proton to donate, then the base must be able to accept a proton.            This means that the base must have somewhere for the proton to become            attached to &ndash; that            is, it must contain an non-bonded (lone) pair of electrons for the proton            to interact (bond) with. If we look at all our examples, we find that            indeed, all our bases have the necessary non-bonded pair of electrons.            Most common bases have either an oxygen or a nitrogen (with lone pairs            of electrons) acting as the basic center, and once you learn how to spot            the basic center, you can predict the outcome of a vast range of reactions &ndash; reactions            that you might otherwise be forced to memorize. In fact, it is often            the case that if you can identify the acidic and basic sites in the starting            materials you can predict the product, while ignoring the rest of the            molecule. <br />            <br />            In general, nitrogen is a better proton acceptor than oxygen, that            is, it is more basic. Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is more basic than water (H<sub>2</sub>O),            and organic compounds with nitrogen in them are typically more basic            than the corresponding compounds containing a structurally analogous            oxygen. If we compare the trend in basicity for a range of simple            compounds across the periodic table, we see that basicity decreases            from NH<sub>3</sub> &gt; H<sub>2</sub>O &gt; HF. </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td width="577" class="black"> This effect parallels            the increase in electronegativity across the row.
