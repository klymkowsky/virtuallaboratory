Similarly, the rate at which you travel down            the road (your speed) is given in miles per hour (or km/hr). A child            might grow at the rate of an inch or two per year (while the aged            can shrink), and some plants (like kudzu) can grow at the rate of            a inches per day. The units of rate are (an amount) divided by (a            period of time). While this might seem too obvious to dwell upon,            it is worth noting that most real processes do not have a constant            rate of change; rates themselves can, and do change &ndash; this            is one reason why the calculus is useful in chemistry, since it provides            the mathematical tools needed to deal with changing rates, like those            associated with planetary motions, falling bodies, and (it turns            out) chemical reactions. <br />        </p></td>    <td width="12">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="194"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter8txt.html" target="_self">8.1 How for, how fast?</a><br />        <strong>8.2 Reaction rate</strong><br />        <a href="chapter8txt-3.html" target="_self">8.3 Activation energy</a><br />        <a href="chapter8txt-4.html" target="_self">8.4       Catalysis</a><br />      <a href="chapter8txt-5.html" target="_self">8.5 Equilibrium</a><br />      <a href="chapter8txt-6.html" target="_self">8.6 Mechanisms</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black"><br />        If we apply this same idea to the            speed of a chemical reaction, what do we have to be able to measure            to determine a reaction&rsquo;s rate?

First, the reactants will have to be mixed together. The best way to make a homogeneous mixture is to form solutions, and it is true that many reactions take place in solution. When reactions do involve a solid, like the rusting of iron, the reactants interact with one another at a surface. To increase the probability of such a reaction, it is common to use a solid that is very finely divided, so that it has a large surface area, allowing the reactants more places to collide. </p>    <p class="black">We will begin a more in depth look at reaction rates with        a simple hypothetical reaction that occurs slowly, but with a reasonable        rate in solution. Our &ldquo;toy&rdquo; reaction will be A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub> &harr; 2AB.&nbsp; Since        the reaction is slow, that means that the loss of reactants (A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>)        and the production of product (AB) will also be slow, but measurable. </p></td>    <td><img src="graphics/ch8-1.jpg" width="238" height="337" /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p class="black">Over a reasonable period of time, the concentrations            of A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> and AB change significantly. If we were to watch the rate            of the forward reaction (A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub> &harr; 2AB), we would find that it begins            to slow down. One way to visualize this is if we plot the concentration            of a reactant versus time, we see that the relationship between them            is not linear, but falls off gradually as time increases. We can            get measures of rates at any given time by taking the slope of the            tangent to the line at that instant, and as you can see these            slopes decrease as time goes by. On the other hand, immediately after            mixing A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>, we would find that the back reaction (that is 2AB            &harr; A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>) is zero &ndash; because of course there is no AB            around to react, at least initially. As the forward reaction proceeds,            however, the concentration of AB increases, and the back reaction            rate increases (as indicated by the slopes of the tangents to the            curve).

For a reaction to occur (some of) the bonds holding the reactant molecules together must break, and new bond(s) must be formed to create the products. We can also think of forward and backward reactions in terms of probabilities. The forward reaction rate is determined by the probability that a collision between an A<sub>2</sub> and a B<sub>2</sub> molecule provides enough energy to break the A-A and B-B bonds, together with the probability of an AB molecule forming. The back reaction rate is determined by the probability that collisions (with surrounding molecules) will provide sufficient energy to break the A-B bond, together with the probability that the As and Bs released find other As and Bs to form A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> molecules. Remember, collisions are critical, since there are no &ldquo;reactions at a distance&rdquo;. What exact steps are involved in the forward and back reactions are not specified, but we can make a  prediction - if these steps are unlikely to occur (low probability), the reactions will be slow.</p>    <p class="black"> As the reaction proceeds, the forward reaction rate will        decrease because the concentrations of A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> decrease, while the        back reaction rate will increase, as the concentration of AB increases.        At some point, the two reaction rates will be equal and opposite - this        is the point of equilibrium. This point could occur at a high concentration        of AB or a low one, depending upon the reaction. At the macroscopic level        we recognize the equilibrium state by the fact that there are no further        changes in the concentrations of reactants and products, but this is    due to the huge numbers of molecules involved.</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="528"><p class="black"> It is important to understand that                at the molecular level, the reactions have not stopped.
