Second, while there is more or less free rotation        around the axis of a single bond, rotation is blocked by the presence        of a double bond.

The minimum energy arrangement for            three centers is a two-dimensional arrangement in which the groups            are oriented at about 120&ordm; to one another; an arrangement known            as trigonal planar geometry.</p>        <p>There is one more common type of bond that carbon can form - which            is a triple bond. For example C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (ethyne) has three centers of            electron density: the two single sp hybrid orbital bonds between        the Cs and Hs and a triple bond, which can be thought of as a &sigma; bond and two perpendicularly oriented &pi; bonds, between the carbons. The lowest energy arrangement between three negative charges is a line, in which the angle between the bonds is 180&ordm;. As before, a triple bond is less stable than three single bonds, and rearrangements can be expected! </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="492"><p class="black">We see that under most conditions, a                carbon atom can participate in a maximum of four bonds; either                four single bonds, two single bonds and a double bond, or one                single bond and a triple bond.
