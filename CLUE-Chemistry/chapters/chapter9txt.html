While chemistry lab experiments typically involve            mixing pure chemicals together in well defined amounts under tightly            controlled conditions, in the wild, things are messier. There are            usually a number of chemical species present, and that can lead to            competing reactions. While laboratory systems are effectively &ldquo;closed&rdquo;,            and the results are analyzed only after the reaction has reached            equilibrium, real systems are usually open and rarely reach equilibrium.            This is particularly true for living systems - which tend to be dead            if they reach equilibrium (or become enclosed). In fact most real            systems are subject to frequent short and long term perturbations.            For example, as we saw in the last chapter, perturbations to a system            (adding or taking away a product or a reactant) lead to compensatory            changes - the system responds, as described by Le Chatelier&rsquo;s            principle. This essentially simple behavior can, in the context of            more complex system, produce quite dramatic behaviors. Life is an            example of such a system, a system that has (in its various forms)            survived uninterrupted for over 3.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> years.<br />        </p></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="164"><p class="black1"><a href="http://highlighter.com/reader?hash=lnk-3774962" target="_blank"><img src="graphics/chapter9.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="300" /></a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>        <td height="1204"><p class="black">In this chapter we will examine a range of complex                systems. We will consider how living systems manage to keep the                concentration of important chemical species at a reasonable level                (for example by buffering the pH), how they manage to use differences                in concentrations of chemical species to drive cellular processes                (like thought), and how reactions that release energy (by forming                more stable compounds) can be coupled to reactions that require        energy to occur. </p>            <p class="black"><strong>Systems composed of one reaction</strong></p>            <p class="black">We begin by considering a few of the reactions                    that are important to us and that can either be moved backwards                    or forwards depending on conditions. Molecular oxygen                    (O<sub>2</sub>) is a vital component in a number of reactions                    in our bodies, particularly energy capture from food, through                    an evolutionarily ancient process known as aerobic respiration.                    O<sub>2</sub> must be transported to every cell so that it                    can participate in cellular reactions. O<sub>2</sub> diffuses                    into the bloodstream in the lungs, but O<sub>2</sub> is not                    very soluble in water (the main component of blood). If we                    relied on O<sub>2</sub>&lsquo;s                solubility in water to transport it around the body we would                be in trouble. Instead O<sub>2</sub> reacts with (we usually                say binds to, but this is definitely a chemical reaction) a protein                called hemoglobin. The structure of hemoglobin is complex; it                is composed of four polypeptide subunits, each polypeptide is                associated with a heme group. The heme group contains an iron                ion (Fe2+) complexed to four nitrogenous bases? linked into a                ring (called a porphyrin) to form a more or less planar arrangement.                A similar molecule, known as chlorophyll, differs most dramatically                from heme in that the iron ion is replaced by magnesium (see                below). Its function is not to bind O<sub>2</sub> (or CO<sub>2</sub>), but rather to                absorb visible light and release an energetic electron as part                of the photosynthetic process.</p>            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td width="73%"><span class="black">Iron is a transition metal. Recall that these elements have d                orbitals, some of which are empty and available for bonding.                Iron II (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) has plenty of energetically available orbitals,                and therefore can form Lewis acid-base complexes with compounds                that have available electrons (such as nitrogenous bases). Within                the porphyrin ring, four N&rsquo;s interact with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion.                Typically transition metals form complexes that are octahedral                in geometry. In the case of the heme group, four of these interactions                involve nitrogens from the four rings, a fifth involves an N                of histidine residue of one of the protein&rsquo;s polypeptides                that approaches from below the ring plane. This leaves one site                open for the binding of an O<sub>2</sub> molecule, which has                available lone electron pairs.190 When an O<sub>2</sub> binds                to one of these heme groups, <br />                Hemoglobin + O<sub>2</sub> &harr; Hemoglobin-O<sub>2</sub>.</span></td>                <td width="27%"><img src="graphics/ch9-1.jpg" width="200" height="233" /></td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="black">This way of depicting the reaction is an oversimplification.                As we said initially, each hemoglobin molecule contains four                polypeptides each of which is associated with a heme group (green                in the figure), so there are four heme groups in a single hemoglobin                molecule. Each heme group can bind one O<sub>2</sub> molecule. As an O<sub>2</sub>molecule binds to the heme iron, there are structural and electronic                changes that take place within the protein as a whole - this                leads to a process known as cooperativity - the four heme groups                do not act independently.</p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td width="17%"><img src="graphics/ch9-2.jpg" width="111" height="60" /></td>                <td width="83%"><span class="black">Binding of O<sub>2</sub> to one of the four heme                groups in hemoglobin causes structural changes to the protein,                which increases the affinity of remaining three heme groups for                O<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, when a second O<sub>2</sub> binds, it again increases the                affinity for O<sub>2</sub> of the remaining two heme groups. </span></td>              </tr>            </table><p class="black">As you might suspect, this process is reversible.                    Imagine a hemoglobin protein with four bound O<sub>2</sub>s. When an                    O<sub>2</sub> is released from the hemoglobin molecule, the affinity                    between the remaining O2s and the heme groups is reduced,                    making it more likely that more of the bound O<sub>2</sub>s will be                    released. This is an equilibrium reaction, and we can apply                    Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle to it. Where                O<sub>2</sub> is present in high abundance (in the lungs) the reaction shifts                to the right (binding and increasing affinity for O<sub>2</sub>), and where                O<sub>2</sub> is present at low levels, the reaction shifts to the left,                releasing O<sub>2</sub> and reduced affinity for O<sub>2</sub>.) The end result is                a molecule (hemoglobin) that has high capacity for binding O<sub>2</sub> where O<sub>2</sub> is present at high concentrations and readily releases                O<sub>2</sub> where O<sub>2</sub> is present at low concentrations. In the blood [hemoglobin]                ranges between 135-170 g/L, approximately 2 mM, and since there                are 4 O<sub>2</sub> binding sites per hemoglobin, this leads to about ~8                mM concentration of O<sub>2</sub> - this compares to O<sub>2</sub>2s&rsquo;s solubility                in water which is ~ 8mg/L at 37&ordm;C, or 250 &mu;M).
