How can we explain            this observation? Well, first we can reassure ourselves that matter            has not been destroyed &ndash; if we weigh the solution, it weighs            the same as 50 mL of water plus 50 mL of ethanol. This means that            the density of the water:ethanol solution must be greater than the            density of either the water or ethanol solutions alone. If we think            molecularly, we can immediately deduce that in the ethanol and water            mixture the molecules are closer together than they are when pure            (before mixing). On the other hand, if you take 50mL of oil and 50            mL of water, we find that they do not mix &ndash; no matter how hard            we try, they always separate away from one another in two layers.            What factors determine whether substances will form solutions?<br />            </p></td>    <td width="19">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="190"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter6txt.html" target="_self">6.1 Solutions </a><br />        <strong>6.2 Solubility </strong><br />        <a href="chapter6txt-3.html">6.3 H-bonds</a><br />        <a href="chapter6txt-4.html" target="_self">6.4       Free Energy</a><br />      <a href="chapter6txt-5.html" target="_self">6.5 Polarity</a><br />      <a href="chapter6txt-6.html" target="_self">6.6 Temperature</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black"><br />        First, we need to be aware that solubility is not an            all or nothing property. In the case of oil and water, if we were            to look carefully, we would find that a small number of oil molecules            are present in the water (the aqueous phase), while a small number            of water molecules will be found in the oil. There are a number of            ways to describe solubility; probably the most common is to define            the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. This is called            the solution&rsquo;s molarity (M, mol/L).        Another common way is to define the number grams of solute per mass of        solution (for example: 1 mg (10<sup>-3</sup> g) of solute dissolved in 1Kg        (10<sup>3</sup>        g) of solution is 1 part per million (10<sup>6</sup>) solute - 1ppm.        As you might expect, given the temperature term in the free energy equation,        solubility data are always reported at a particular temperature. At a        given temperature, if no more solute will dissolve, the solution is said        to be saturated (and of course if more solute could dissolve it is unsaturated)</p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">How would you design an experiment to determine the solubility of a solute?</li>        <li class="black">How would you determine whether a solution was saturated?<br />        </li>      </ul>      <hr width="60%" size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions to ponder:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">You have a saturated solution, with some solid solute present. </li>        <li class="black">Do you think the solute particles that are in solution are the same ones over time? </li>        <li class="black">How would you determine whether they were the same?</li>      </ul>      <hr size="1" noshade /></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td class="black"><p>If we look at the structure of compounds that dissolve in water, we can begin to see some trends: hydrocarbons, that is compounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen (chapter 4) are not very soluble in water, while alcohols (that is: hydrocarbons with an -OH group attached) with up to 3 carbons are completely soluble.  As the number of carbon atoms increases the solubility in water decreases, for example: hexanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) is only very slightly soluble in water (0.4 g/L). So perhaps the hydroxyl (&ndash;OH) group is responsible.
