In a redox                reaction, polar products are generated from non-polar reactants.                You may have run into such reactions already (even if you did                not know what they are called!) When iron is left in contact                with oxygen (in air) and water, it rusts. The iron is transformed                from a hard, non-polar metallic substance (Fe solid) into a powdery                substance Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.nH<sub>2</sub>O(s). Rusting                is mechanistically similar to the reactions that occurs when                copper turns green, silver tarnishes (turns black), and perhaps                the favorite reaction of chemists everywhere, the explosive reaction        that occurs when sodium metal is added to water. </span></p></td>    <td width="13">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="215"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter7txt.html" target="_self">7.1 Reactions </a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-2.html" target="_self">7.2 Types (Acid-Base)</a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-3.html" target="_self">7.3 Lewis Acid-Base</a><br />        <a href="chapter7txt-4.html" target="_self">7.4       Nucleo- &amp; Electrophiles</a><br />      <strong>7.5 Oxidation-Reduction</strong><br />      <a href="chapter7txt-6.html" target="_self">7.6 Energetics</a><br />    </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><p class="black">All of these reactions start off            with a metal in its elemental form. Pure metals have no charge or            permanent unequal distribution of charge (that makes them different,            for example, from salts, like NaCl). As the reaction proceeds (here            we will use the sodium-water reaction as the focus of our discussion),            the metal atoms becomes cations. They lose electrons to another molecule            and becomes positively charged. In our example, sodium metal Na(s)            reacts with water to form Na+(aq) &ndash; a completely different            (and much less reactive) species. That is, of course, only half the            story. The &ldquo;lost&rdquo; electrons from sodium must go somewhere            (since, in chemical reactions, we don&rsquo;t            need to consider matter-energy inter-conversion). The question is            where? <br />        <br />        The overall reaction of sodium and water is: 2Na(s) + 2H<sub>w</sub>O(l)        &harr; 2Na+(aq) + 2&ndash;OH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)<br />        It turns out that this reaction is actually somewhat complicated (although we like it because it is explosive), so we will come back to it shortly. </p>      <p class="black">An easier reaction to analyze is that between sodium and          chlorine to form sodium chloride.<br />          2Na(s) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) &harr;  2NaCl(s)<br />          <br />          We have already looked at the structure of ionic compounds (in chapter          4) and have seen that they are best modeled (that is, represented and          thought about) by considering NaCl as a three dimensional lattice of          alternating positive (Na+) and negative (Cl&ndash;) ions. Here is the answer to where the electrons from the sodium atoms go, they are transferred to another reactant in the mixture, namely chlorine atoms. This transfer leads to the breakup of a Cl2 molecule into two Cl&ndash; ions.  We define a process in which a species loses electrons an oxidation, and the corresponding gain of electrons is called a reduction (even though that seems somewhat counterintuitive).  </p>      <p class="black">At the simplest level we could write:<br />          Na &rarr; Na+ +e&ndash;	 (an oxidation reaction) and Cl + e&ndash; &harr;          Cl &ndash; ( a reduction reaction). <br />          <br />          It turns out that all reactions in which elements react with each other          to form compounds are redox reactions. For example: the reaction of          molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen is also a redox reaction:<br />          2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) &harr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)<br />          <br />          The problem here is that there is no obvious transfer of electrons.          Neither is there an obvious reason why these two elements should react          in the first place, since neither of them has any charge polarity that          might lead to an initial interaction. That being said, there is no          doubt that H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> react, in fact they (like sodium) and water) react          explosively. When we look a little more closely at the reaction,          we can see that there is a shift in electron density on individual          atoms as they move from being reactants to products. The reactants          contain only pure covalent (H&ndash;H and O&ndash;O) bonds, while in          the product (H<sub>2</sub>O) the bonds are polarized: H&delta;+ and O&delta;&ndash; (recall          that oxygen is a highly electronegative atom because of its high effective          nuclear charge). There has been a shift in overall electron density          towards the oxygen. While this is a bit more subtle than the NaCl case,          the oxygen has gained some &ldquo;extra&rdquo; electron density, and          so it has been reduced, but not by a whole electron, just a part of          one. Similarly, the hydrogen has been oxidized, but again, not by a          whole electron, but by part of one. This can be confusing, since electrons          are elementary particles, they do not have parts - we are really talking          about where the electron spends most of its time, that is the electron          density. In order to keep this straight, chemists have developed a          system to keep track of the losses and gains in electron density, they          use oxidation numbers. </p>      <p class="black"><strong>Oxidation: states and numbers</strong></p>      <p class="black"> Now we may seem to be moving into the area of arcane          terms, designed to confuse the non-chemist, but in fact, oxidation          numbers (or oxidation states) can be relatively easy to grasp as long          as you remember a few basic principles.<br />          <br />          For an ion, the charge is the oxidation number. The oxidation number              of Na+ is +1, the oxidation number of the oxide ion (O<sub>2</sub>&ndash;) is &ndash;2.<br />          <br>        For elements that are covalently bonded to a different element, we    imagine that ALL the electrons in the bond are moved to the most electronegative    atom to make it charged. As an example, in water the oxygen is the    more electronegative atom. We therefore imagine that the bonding electrons    are on oxygen, this means that the hydrogen atoms have no electrons    (and so has a +1 charge). The oxidation number of H (in water) is +1,    while oxygen, while two (imagined) extra electrons as a  &ndash;2 charge &ndash; its oxidation number is &ndash;2. <br />          Elements always have an oxidation number of zero (because all of the          atoms in a pure element are the same, so none of the bonds are polar.)</p><p class="black"> Remember this is just a way to keep track of the electrons, oxidation numbers are not real, they are just a helpful device.  It is also important to remember that the oxidation number (or state) of an atom is dependent upon its molecular context. The trick to spotting a redox reaction is to see if the oxidation number of an atom changes from reactants to products. </p>      <p class="black">In the reaction 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)  &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)<br />          <br />          H changes from zero in the reactants to +1 in the products, and the          oxygen goes from zero to &ndash;2.  When oxidation numbers change during          a reaction, the reaction is a redox reaction. <br />          Now back to sodium and water reaction. Let us see if we can spot what          which reduced (we know the sodium gets oxidized, because it loses an          electron). </p>      <p class="black">Obviously it must be the oxygen or hydrogen (or could          it be both?)<br />2Na(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) &rarr; 2Na+(aq) + 2&ndash;OH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)<br />          <br />          If we check for changes in oxidation state, the oxygen in water starts          at &ndash;2 and in hydroxide (&ndash;OH) it is still &ndash;2, it has          not been reduced or oxidized. If we check the hydrogens, we see two          distinct fates. One of the hydrogen atoms stays bonded to the oxygen          atom (in hydroxide); it starts at +1 and stays there. However the other          type ends up bonded to another hydrogen atom meaning that it started          at +1 and ends at zero: it is these two hydrogen atoms that have been          reduced!<br />          <br />          The historical origins of the term oxidation involve reaction with          oxygen, for example in combustion reactions, the simplest of which          can be written as: CH<sub>4</sub>(g)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g)<br />          <br />      </p></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>        <td width="512"><p class="black1"><span class="black">Oxidation reactions                    like this provide major sources of energy, not only by burning                    fuel (natural gas, gasoline, coal etc), but also in biological                    systems where carbon containing molecules, such as sugars                    and lipids, react with molecular oxygen, to form compounds                    with very stable bonds (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O)                    and releasing energy that can be used to break bonds and        rearrange molecules. </span></p></td>        <td width="13">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="215"><p class="black1"><a href="chapter7txt.html" target="_self">7.1                    Reactions </a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-2.html" target="_self">7.2 Types (Acid-Base)</a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-3.html" target="_self">7.3 Lewis Acid-Base</a><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-4.html" target="_self">7.4 Nucleo- &amp; Electrophiles</a><br />            <strong>7.5 Oxidation-Reduction</strong><br />            <a href="chapter7txt-6.html" target="_self">7.6 Energetics</a><br />        </p></td>    </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>    <td><hr size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Question to answer:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li><span class="black">For the reaction CH<sub>4</sub>(g)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g), which atoms are oxidized and which reduced?<br />          Write an explanation to a friend who has no chemistry background to explain the difference between these two reactions that give the same product.<br />          2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)<br />          H+(aq) + &ndash;OH(aq) &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</span><br />        </li>      </ul>      <hr width="60%" size="1" noshade />      <p class="black"><strong>Questions to ponder:</strong></p>      <ul>        <li class="black">What would happen if you could separate out the oxidation reaction (where electrons are lost) and the reduction reaction (where electrons are gained).
